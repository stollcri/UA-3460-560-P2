\f0\fs28 \cf0 After the boilerplate text is removed from the raw data, regular expressions are used to remove a broader range of useless data. Dates and times found in the raw data are not useful for classifying and solving problems, so they are removed. If temporal information was desired it could be extracted from the database in a uniform format. During this step special characters are also removed and white spaces are compressed.}
