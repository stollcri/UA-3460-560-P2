\f0\fs28 \cf0 Since this application was experimental and it could potentially take a lot of time to process an entire corpus, it was written as a set of independent Python scripts which can be run independently from the command line. Python was chosen because that is the native language of the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). No interactive query interface was designed as of yet, only the train and test portions were designed in order to analyze the performance of the application.}
