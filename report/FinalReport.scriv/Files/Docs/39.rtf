\f0\fs28 \cf0 The approach taken here yields very poor results with the given corpus sizes. The number of correct solutions may improve with larger corpus sizes, but further work would need to be done to determine this. Improving the phrase matching algorithm may also help, but the biggest improvement would likely come from using a different approach.\
The data sets have also been processed using Weka to check for correlations between the service desk ticket problem and the solution category. Initial tests with the second data set seem to suggest that categorization rates of better than 85% are possible. However, categorization is just one step towards providing a solution. More work needs to be done in systematically verifing the categorization rates and then providing solutions in that even more limited domain.}
