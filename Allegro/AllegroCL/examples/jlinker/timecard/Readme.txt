* What is this?

     The files in this directory define a simple timekeeping application.
     The Lisp code keeps track of start and stop times for various projects
     and calls Java AWT methods to show a simple spreadsheet interface to
     the user.


* How to make it work?

     - Copy this entire directory to a convenient place
     - cd to the copy
     - copy <acl-distribution>/jlinker/jl-config.cl to this directory
     - customize the copy of jl-config.cl as indicated in comments in the file
     - copy <acl-distribution>/jlinker/jlinker.jar to this directory
     - start acl in the copied folder
     - top-level command:   :cl main.cl
     - evaluate expression: (main)
     - After some progress messages, a window will appear with menus
        buttons and pull-down lists.
     - to view a timesheet filled in with many days of data,
       select menus File -> Open...
       and pick the file timestmp.316.

SIDEBAR: What does it mean "start ACL in folder foo"?

How to "start ACL in folder foo"?

The goal of this step is to have ACL running with the current default
folder (directory )in ACL being the folder (directory) foo.  This kind
of operation is useful because after this step, files in folder foo
can be manipulated without any folder (directory) prefixes that make
examples long and hard to read.



Windows:

There are several ways to reach this goal:

 1. Select one of the ACL executables from the Start Menu
    AND THEN, in the Lisp console window or the Lisp debug
    window, enter the command

          :cd full-path-to-folder

 2. Open a DOS Command Prompt Window and then enter the commands

          cd full-path-to-folder
          full-path-to-ACL-executable

 3. Create a shortcut to ACL in the working folder (foo) and
    make sure that the "Start in" line on the shortcut Properties
    window is blank.

    Double-click on the shortcut.

 4. Create a shortcut to ACL in some convenient place, and
    make sure that the "Start in" line on the shortcut Properties
    window points to the folder foo.

    Double-click on the shortcut.


Unix:

 1. Select one of the ACL executables and start it from a
    command shell,  AND THEN, at the Lisp console prompt,
    enter the command

          :cd full-path-to-folder

 2. In a suitable shell window or buffer, enter the commands

          cd full-path-to-folder
          full-path-to-ACL-executable
