#|
- implement STOU (store unique)?
- add support for REST command?
- suggestions from jkf:
  It would be useful to let the user know what kind of error occurred
  if a connection to an ftp server failed.  It seems there are four kinds of
  errors:
  1.  bogus hostname.   retrying isn't going to be useful
  2.  connection refused.  retrying a few times may be useful
  3.  user/password not accepted.   retrying isn't going to be useful
  4.  server too full.   retrying is going to be useful

multiple commands can be sent to the same server without having to close

be quite difficult to make a connection, so having to reestablish it might
not be a good idea.
