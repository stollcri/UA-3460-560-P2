;; Using the tree grapher for arbitrary (non-class) objects

;; The grapher is not productized as a general facility
;; for incorporating into user applications, and is not documented
;; other than by this example code.  It may nevertheless be
;; useful to model after this example in order to use the
;; grapher for custom tools within the IDE.  The grapher code
;; is not present in a standalone CG application.

;; Sample hierarchical domain data

;; Each entry here is a list of a parent and its children.
;; The actual data could be arranged in any way, as long as
;; you can pass a function below to map from a parent to its children.
;; You would also more likely use CLOS instances rather than symbols
;; in a real application.
