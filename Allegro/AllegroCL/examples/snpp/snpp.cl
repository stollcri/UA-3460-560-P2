Usage: snpp [-d] [-n] [-h host] -u user message...
-d        debug mode: print informative messages
          (all by itself, -d runs a primitive top-level)
-n        no-execute mode: don't really send the page
-h host   send to `host'
-u user   send to `user'
message   remaining arguments are the message.

Note: if it exists, ~~/.snpprc is used to store aliases for the -u
      argument.  The format of this file is 0 or more lists of the form
          (alias host user)
      where `alias' is given to -u and `host' and `user' are used as the
      real values of -h and -u.  For example, a .snpprc of:
          (\"devil\" \"hell.com\" 666)
      would allow this command:
          snpp -u devil you suck, dude
      instead of this:
          snpp -u 666 -h hell.com you suck, dude
