;; This example shows how to use excl.osi:fork on non-Windows
;; platforms to utilize all available processors for Lisp computations.
;; It assumes that your application has compute bound parts which can be
;; run in parallel.  In the example below, the "work" is simulated with a
;; loop calling expt.
;;
;; This technique is not appropriate for problems where the granularity of
;; parallelism is very fine.  The overhead would be too large for those
;; problems.  The overhead is such that around 11,500 calls per second can
;; be made with this framework, on a 1.8GHz x86_64 machine.
;;
;; The first part of the example code is a framework for executing the work
;; units on different processors.  The second part is a specific example
;; using this framework.
;;
;; This example does not use anything fancy to pass information between the
;; parent and child processes, just the printer and reader.  The less
;; information passed the less overhead there will be.
;;
;; Terminology:
;;   task      :: a unit of work, or, in lisp terms, an expression that can
;;                be evaluated
;;   CPU       :: an actual hardware processor
;;   processor :: an entity which can do work, or in terms of this example
;;                a lisp subprocess which performs a task on a CPU
;;
;; There can (and often will) be more processors than CPUs, though if there
;; are many more processors than CPUs then tasks might take much longer
;; than expected to complete.
;;
;; In the "Example" section, there is an example which is run with varying
;; number of processors.  For each run, there is an idea of the single
;; processor time it would take to complete.  This is labeled "WORK" in the
;; test run below.  In a theoretical sense, if there was 100 seconds of
;; work to be done, 4 CPUs and the tasks the right size and independent of
;; each other, it you might get the work done in 25 seconds of real time.
;;
;; Here is an example run on 4 processor Opteron system.  Each processor is
;; running at 1.8GHz.

;; Not nearly as good as the first system, which as it happens costs about

;; As was said at the outset, this approach isn't for every application.  I
;; can be very useful without a lot of trouble.  The main benefit is that
;; in the presence of multiple processors, an application can increase
;; efficiency without a lot of work.  The downside, which can be overcome
