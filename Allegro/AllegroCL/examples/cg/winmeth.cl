;; Customizing window behavior by adding methods to a window subclass.

;; This is a general example of the sort of method-writing you
;; typically need to do in order to create windows in your
;; application that know how to draw themselves and respond to
;; mouse and keyboard events as needed by your application.

;; -------------------------------------------------------------
;; To add our own window methods, we must first create our
;; own window subclass to specialize on.  If a window class
;; that instantiates a pane inside it is desired, we must
;; also subclass the pane class and point the frame class
;; to the pane class to instantiate.

(in-package :cg-user)

;; Create a window subclass for the frame window.
(defclass my-window (non-refreshing-window)
  ()
  (:default-initargs
      :title "My Window"
    :scrollbars t
    :page-width 1100
    :font (make-font-ex nil :arial 24)))

;; Create a pane subclass for the child pane window.
(defclass my-pane (non-refreshing-pane)
  nil)

;; Tell the frame subclass to instantiate the pane subclass.
(defmethod default-pane-class ((window my-window))
  'my-pane)

;; Above we have used a subclass of frame-with-single-child,
;; and so we needed to define a pane class to go with it.  Using
;; a pane at all is not always necessary, since you can
;; alternately instantiate and draw directly on a frame-window,
;; for example.  But using a frame-child pane comes in handy
;; if you want to add a toolbar or status bar to the frame window,
;; since these will not overlap a frame-child pane (and will not
;; interfere with scrolling the pane), or if you
;; need to use a special type of pane such as text-edit-pane
;; which has functionality not provided by the frame window itself.
