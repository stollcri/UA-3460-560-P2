;;; Scrolling by logical objects rather than by pixels.
;;; This requires a "custom scrolling scheme" where
;;; several default methods are overridden by the application.

#|
In a typical custom scrolling scheme, an application does
not need to worry about how much data is above the current
scroll position, and simply starts drawing whatever is
currently scrolled to the top of the window.  This means
that the application does not have to compute and/or cache
the pixel sizes of everything above the scroll-position,
which simplifies the coding and can also speed scrolling up
quite a bit when there is a huge amount of data to be scrolled.

The drawbacks are that (1) this approach may be applicable
only if data is entirely arranged into "rows" or "columns",
(2) scrolling is not as visually smooth since an individual
data object is always aligned with the top and/or left side
of the window, and (3) custom methods need to be written to
override several CG generic functions that are exported for
this purpose.  The generic functions to override include
scroll-to, nscroll-position, scroll-range, set-scroll-range,
update-scroll-bars-for-new-window-size, and user-scroll.
Custom methods may not be needed for all of these, depending
on how the scrolling scheme is designed.
