;; How to Define a Lisp Widget --- Vertical Gauge Example

;; This file implements a "vertical gauge" widget as an example
;; of defining a new widget completely in lisp.  The gauge draws
;; a vertical bar beside a numeric scale, and the user can click
;; or drag to move the bar to a new value.  You can use this sample
;; code as a template for defining your own widgets, using arbitrary
;; lisp code to tell the widget how to draw itself and how to
;; respond to mouse clicks and keypresses.

;; While it is possible to make a generic window act like a widget
;; by simply giving it suitable drawing and mousing behavior, we
;; have set up the classes lisp-widget and lisp-widget-window
;; that you can subclass in order to create a common graphics-style
;; widget, where a dialog-item object is associated with a window
;; object, the dialog-item's on-set-focus is called automatically
;; at the appropriate time, and so on.

;; The steps that you must take include:
;; * Define your dialog-item and widget-window classes.
;; * Write a device-open method that sets up the widget-window initially.
;; * Define a redisplay-window method that draws the widget.
;; * Define event-handling methods to handle mouse clicks and keypresses.
;; These steps are detailed in the code below.

;; This file defines the widget for programmatic creation.
