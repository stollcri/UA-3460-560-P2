\viewkind4\uc1\pard\ri1280\f0\fs20 Here is some sample rich text, containing a \b bold\b0  word, an \i italic\i0  word, and a couple of \b\i bold italic\b0\i0  \cf1 words.  And how about \ul some underlined words\ulnone .  \f1 This last \b sentence\b0  of the first \b paragraph\b0  is in the arial font.

\par \pard\ri1000\f2 Using the optional hypertext facility of the rich-edit control, you can left-click on the following blue hypertext link to jump to the another rich-text file called \cf2 rich-edit-sample-2\cf1 .rtf.  Then right-click to come back here.  This works because the rich-edit control from which this text was saved was given the optional \cf3 save-links\cf1  property, which updates the blue text (by default) as links whenever you save the file.\f1

\par \pard\li720\f0\fs28 This \cf4 third \fs26 paragraph\cf1\fs28  is in a \cf3\b\i larger\cf1\b0\i0  font and is indented.  Let's make it long enough to wrap a couple of times so that we can see its larger line-height.
