;;;; Graphics and events (bouncing boxes)

(in-package :cg-user)

;; Introduction 
;; 
;; We define a new type of window BOXES-WINDOW that depicts 2 colorful boxes.
;; Whenever our window gets a message it moves the boxes by one pixel. 
;; They bounce off the borders of the window and each other.

;; In addition to moving the boxes on mouse and keyboard events, a timer
;; is also set up to move the boxes automatically by one pixel every
;; one-tenth of a second (every 100 milliseconds).

;; Several BOXES-WINDOWs can be open at once with out interference.
;; The timer messages will be sent to all of the open BOXES-WINDOWs, while
;; each window responds independently to other events that occur within it.

;;;; Try doing the following: 
;;;; 
;;;;    1) Run this example to open a BOXES-WINDOW 
;;;;          The boxes will move as timer events are directed to the selected 
;;;;          window 
;;;; 
;;;;    2) Click on some other window to select it 
;;;;          The boxes stop moving because the timer events are going to the 
;;;;          text window 
;;;; 
;;;;    3) Move the mouse in circles over the BOXES-WINDOW 
;;;;          The boxes start moving because mouse-moved events are directed to 
;;;;          the BOXES-WINDOW 
;;;; 
;;;;    4) Click on the boxes window
;;;;          The boxes will move fast because a click is programmed to move
;;;;          300 steps at once, instead of 1 step as with other events.
