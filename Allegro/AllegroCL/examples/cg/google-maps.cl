Defining and Displaying Google Maps from Lisp

The program below shows how to use lisp to display a set of street
addresses and/or other geographical locations together in a Google
map.  The lisp code does this by writing HTML text that contains
JavaScript code into a file, and then displaying that file in an HTML
browser.  The JavaScript code calls functions in the Google Maps API
to create the map, which is then displayed in a Common Graphics HTML
widget.  (On Linux a third-party HTML browser will be used instead of
a CG widget.)

Once you have loaded the code, a simple lisp form like this one will
display a map:

(display-addresses '(("Franz Headquarters"
                      "2201 Broadway, Oakland, CA 94607")
                     ("Berkeley Bowl Marketplace"
                      "2020 Oregon Street, Berkeley, CA 94703")
                     ("Nifty Trails on the Hill"
                      37.8643 -122.241)))

In that example, the first two entries are street addresses while the
third specifies a latitude and longitude directly.  The first string
in every entry is a label to display when the user moves the mouse
cursor over the marker for that location.  When a street address (or a
more general indicator such as "Oakland, CA") is used, a Google
service is used to convert the address to a latitude and longitude.
The set of all requested locations will be centered in the map, and
the maximum zoom level that can display all locations simultaneously
will be used.

Alternately you can use the widgets on the dialog to enter addresses
interactively one at a time, though that interface does not allow
entering latitudes and longitudes.

Go ahead and place the program code below into a file and compile and
load it (or simply evaluate it).  Then evaluate the example call
above.  An HTML Browser window should appear and display a map.

Here's a second example that adds an entry for the whole city of San
Francisco.  When you evaluate this form, notice how the map will
automatically be zoomed farther out in order to encompass the broader
range of locations.  This example shows a "hybrid" map that combines
features of the street and satellite views.

(display-addresses '(("Franz Headquarters"
                      "2201 Broadway, Oakland, CA 94607")
                     ("Berkeley Bowl Marketplace"
                      "2020 Oregon Street, Berkeley, CA 94703")
                     ("The City" "San Francisco")
                     ("Nifty Trails on the Hill"
                      37.8643 -122.241))
                   :map-type :hybrid)

This last example shows only a single location, and initially shows
the satellite view.  Displaying only a single location causes it to
zoom in as far as possible.

(display-addresses '(("Nifty Trails on the Hill"
                      37.8643 -122.241))
                   :map-type :satellite)

The code automatically computes an area to display that includes all
of the requested addresses plus a bit of margin around them.  In some
areas of the globe, Google may report that you are zoomed in too far,
and not draw a map at all.  If this happens, you can pass the
:min-radius keyword argument to specify a minimum longitude or
latitude "radius" for the area to include in the map.  For example,
specifying :min-radius 0.003 appears to be sufficient for Afghanistan.

Now try some addresses of your own!

If you want to try adding other Google Maps features to this code, the
Google Maps API is documented here:
