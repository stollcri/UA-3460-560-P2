;; Using .bmp bitmap files.

;; This example demonstrates three ways to draw pixmaps that are
;; contained in .bmp bitmap files.  Calling load-pixmap-test
;; with no arguments demonstrates using load-pixmap to create
;; a lisp pixmap array and texture-info-structure from a .bmp
;; file, and then drawing the image from the lisp pixmap array.
;; Note that load-pixmap is much faster for aclwin release 3.0.2.
;; Passing the :make-pixmap-handles argument as non-NIL further
;; creates "device-dependent" pixmaps from the lisp arrays; drawing
;; from the pixmap handle is much faster but uses OS resources and
;; takes longer to initially prepare the pixmap.  
;; Passing :from-file as non-NIL draws images from .bmp files
;; directly without creating an intermediate lisp data object
;; for the bits.
