;; DDE receive-advice example

;; Start running a blank Microsoft Excel.
;; Compile this code and say (setq port (excel-test))
;; When done testing, close the port with (close-port port)

;; This example sets up a "hot" advice link with the Excel DDE server.
;; The link applies only to the top-left cell in the spreadsheet
;; plus the cell just to the right of that.  Whenever you change the
;; value in one of those cells, the Excel DDE server sends us a piece
;; of "advice" which results in a call to the receive-advice method
;; that we supply here for this port.  This simple example
;; simply prints whatever Excel passed to us.

;; The example also shows how to read and write individual cells.
