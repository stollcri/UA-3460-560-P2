;;; Simple Grid Example

;;; The grid-widget is very versatile and has a significant learning
;;; curve, so here is the simplest possible grid example to introduce
;;; the widget.  See the documentation page for the grid-widget class
;;; for an overview of all grid-widget functionality.

;;; This grid simply draws or erases an X in a cell whenever the
;;; user clicks the cell.  It uses a custom draw-cell method to
;;; draw the X, and a custom cell-click method to toggle the
;;; official value for a cell when the user clicks it.

;;; This example stores its data to display in a single array
;;; that's stored on the grid-widget.  This is an array
;;; of boolean values indicating which cells should have an
;;; X drawn in them.  In a real application, your data would
;;; probably be stored elsewhere in your application; there
;;; is additional grid functionality for conveniently reading
;;; the data to display from CLOS objects.

;;; This grid has a single scrolling section.  In a real application
;;; you would probably want to add additional sections, such as for
;;; row and column headers so that the body section can scroll
;;; independently of the header sections.

;;; This grid uses a single grid-row object and a single grid-column
;;; object.  These objects have a "count" property to draw several
;;; visible rows or columns using the single row or column object.
;;; This is possible when it's OK for all of the visible rows or
;;; columns to look and act exactly the same.  If you want a
;;; different appearance or different behavior in various rows or
;;; columns, then you will need to make a separate grid-row or
;;; grid-column object for each one.

;;; This grid does not use any of the handy built-in cell types
;;; such as the ones for letting the user type a string into a
;;; cell or select a value from a drop-down list.  Other grid
;;; examples demonstrate those built-in cell types.
