<p id="5">
Except for installing CLIM and/or the IDE on Macs, the installation of
Allegro CL 8.2 is similar to installation of previous versions of
Allegro CL such as Allegro CL 8.1. For CLIM/IDE installation on Mac
OS, see <a href="#macosx-install-1">here</a>.
</p>
<hr><hr><h2 id="6"><a name="install-intro-1">1.0 Installation introduction</a></h2>


<p id="7">
This document describes how to install Allegro CL and related
products. 
</p>
<p id="8">
Allegro CL is typically downloaded. Customers receive instructions on
how to download Allegro CL
8.18.2 over
the net. Express users download their copy from the Franz Inc. web
site (<a href="http://www.franz.com">www.franz.com</a>).  Express
users should go to
<a href="#express-install-1">Section 12.0 The Express Edition</a>. 
</p>

<p id="9">
You can install Allegro CL from the download without any
key or code (though you need a license file, as described below, in
order to use Allegro CL).  Once Allegro CL is installed, the
documentation, including this file, is available in the
<i>doc/</i> subdirectory (this file is
<i>doc/installation.htm</i>). A copy of this file is
also available on the Franz Inc. web site (<a href="http://www.franz.com">www.franz.com</a>).
</p>
<p id="10">
All types (Professional, Enterprise, etc.) of Allegro CL for a
particular platform and all add-on products are downloaded onto your
computer. A license file named <i>devel.lic</i> controls
which products will be usable. This license file is supplied
separately, as described in
<a href="#license-file-1">Section 10.0 Getting a license file</a>. <b>Allegro CL will not
work without a license file properly installed in the Allegro
directory. The download does not contain a license file. You must
obtain a license file from Franz Inc. separately from the
download.</b>
</p>
<p id="11">
If you do not have a license file or the license file you have does
not seem to license the correct product mix, <a href="introduction.htm#contacting-fi-1">contact your Account
Manager</a> for information. (If that link does not work, call
Franz Inc. in California, USA, at +1 510-452-2000 or send email
to <a href="mailto:support@franz.com">support@franz.com</a> or <a href="mailto:info@franz.com">info@franz.com</a>. In email, be sure to
identify yourself and provide information on how you can be
contacted.)
</p>
<p id="12">
Once you have installed Allegro CL and the license file is in place,
you can use the licensed Allegro CL version and all licensed add-on
products. If you upgrade your Allegro CL version, or purchase a
license for an add-on product, you will be given an updated license
file. You do not have to download further material (except in rare
instances or when you have obtained a license for another
platform). Simply installing the new license file makes the newly
licensed products available for use.

<hr><h2 id="13"><a name="install-definitions-2">1.1 Definitions of some terms used in this document</a></h2>

<ul>
<li id="14">

<b>Allegro directory</b>: the directory where Allegro CL is installed.
On Windows (where the default is programmed into the installation
program), the default is  <i>[Main
Drive, typically C]:\Program Files\acl81\</i>. When we
describe a pathname including the Allegro directory, we typically
surround it in brackets, for example: the directory where you put
patch files is <i>[Allegro directory]/update/</i>.

<b>Download file</b>: the compressed tar file (on UNIX), or the
self-extracting executable file (on Windows), or the .dmg file (on Mac
OS X), which contains the Allegro CL software and which is uncompressed
and untarred (UNIX) or run (Windows) or opened (Mac OS X).

</li>
<li id="16">
<b>Platform</b>: the type of computer you are installing on. Platforms
are identified by Operating Systems (Windows, Solaris, HP-UX, etc.)

<hr><hr><h2 id="34"><a name="pre-install-1">2.0 Preinstallation Steps</a></h2>

<p id="35">
Before installing Allegro CL, consider the following:
</p>

<ol>
<li id="36">



</li>


<li id="37">

<b>The perfstat filesets must be installed on
AIX</b>. See <a href="#aix-pre-install-2">Section 2.1 Installing the perfstat filesets on AIX</a> for
details.

</li>





<li id="38">
<b>You need not uninstall Allegro CL 8.1</b> See
<a href="#acl-81-pre-install-2">Section 2.2 You can leave Allegro CL 8.1 installed</a>.
</li>

</ol>









<hr><h2 id="39"><a name="aix-pre-install-2">2.1 Installing the perfstat filesets on AIX</a></h2>

<p id="40">
In order for Allegro CL to run on AIX the following filesets must be
installed:
</p>
<ul>
<li id="41">

<b>bos.perf.perfstat</b>

</li>
<li id="42">

<b>bos.perf.libperfstat</b>

</li>
</ul>
<p id="43">
These filesets should be available on the AIX installation media.
</p>
<p id="44">
Without these filesets, Lisp will likely fail on startup. The exact
nature of the failure depends of the specific <b>dlopen()</b>
implementation. A typical failure message looks like:
</p>
<pre id="45">
dlopen(/usr/local/allegro/acl81/libacli8110.so, mode) error: Bad address
</pre>












<hr><h2 id="46"><a name="acl-81-pre-install-2">2.2 You can leave Allegro CL 8.1 installed</a></h2>


<p id="47">
It is not necessary to delete version 8.1 if you have that installed,
but note that on Windows, the registry will be updated so extensions
(such as .lpr and .dxl) refer to Allegro CL 8.2 instead of earlier
versions.
</p>





<hr><hr><h2 id="48"><a name="install-steps-1">3.0 Installation steps</a></h2>

<p id="49">
If you have the <b>Express Edition</b>, see
<a href="#express-install-1">Section 12.0 The Express Edition</a>. If you have the
<b>Student Edition</b>, see
<a href="#student-install-1">Section 13.0 The Student Edition</a>. For some platforms,
you are directed back here from that section. In that case, skip down
to step 3.
</p>



<p id="50">
Here are the installation steps in brief:
</p>

<ol>
<li id="51">
<b>Get the license file</b>. See
<a href="#license-file-1">Section 10.0 Getting a license file</a>. You can install
without getting a license file but you cannot use the product without
a license file. 
</li>
<li id="52">
<b>Download the software</b>. You should have received instructions
for downloading from Franz Inc. If not, <a href="introduction.htm#contacting-fi-1">contact your Account
Manager</a> for information. (If that link does not work, call
Franz Inc. in California, USA, at +1 510-452-2000 or send email to <a href="mailto:support@franz.com">support@franz.com</a> or <a href="mailto:info@franz.com">info@franz.com</a>. In email, be sure to
identify yourself and provide information on how you can be
contacted.) We assume below you download the software into
<b>/usr/tmp/</b> on UNIX and <b>C:\\tmp\\</b> on Windows.
<p id="53">
<b>On UNIX (including Linux and Mac OS X)</b>: you
download two files,
<b>acl82.bz2</b> (<b>acl82express-[platform].bz2</b> for the Express
edition and <b>acl82student-[platform].bz2</b> for the Student
edition) and <b>bunzip2</b>. (The [platform] is freebsd or linux-x85
of macosx-x86.) On Mac OS X, you also download a <b>.dmg</b> file. You
can install using the <b>.bz2</b> file as described here or using
the <b>.dmg</b> file as
described <a href="#macosx-install-1">Section 6.0 Installation on Mac OS X</a>.
</p>
<p id="54">
On Windows, you download one file,
<b>acl82.exe</b> (<b>acl82express-x86.exe</b> for the express edition).
</p>


</li>
<li id="55">
<b>UNIX (including Linux and Mac OS X</b>): cd into the
directory where the software was downloaded.  On Solaris, for example,
if you downloaded into <b>/usr/tmp/</b>

<pre id="56">
% cd /usr/tmp/
</pre>
<p id="57">
See <a href="#install-unix-1">Section 4.0 Notes for installation of Allegro CL on UNIX (including Linux)</a> for more details.
</p>
<p id="58">
<b>Windows</b>: find the download executable file in your Windows
Explorer.
</p>
<p id="59">
<b>Mac OS X</b>: you can use the .dmg file -- go
to <a href="#macosx-install-1">Section 6.0 Installation on Mac OS X</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li id="60">
<b>Decide where you wish to install the Allegro Directory.</b>
On UNIX, the typical location is
<i>/usr/local/acl82/</i> (<i>/usr/local/acl82express/</i> for the Express
Edition and <i>/usr/local/acl82student/</i> for the Student
Edition). On Windows, the typical
location is <i>C:\Program Files\acl82\</i>
(<i>C:\Program
Files\acl82-express/</i> for the Express
Edition and <i>&gt;C:\Program
Files\acl82-student/</i> for the Student
Edition). On Mac OS
X, the location is <i>AllegroCL</i> (for 32-bit) and
<i>AllegroCL64</i> (for 64-bit).
However, you can
choose any location you like.

</li>
<li id="61">
<b>UNIX: uncompress and untar the distribution file.</b>
The command is (using the typical location)
<pre id="62">
% ./bunzip2 &lt; acl82.bz2 | (cd /usr/local; tar xf -)
</pre>
<p id="63">
For the Express and Student editions, the bz2 filename has
express-[platform] and student-[platform] appended.
</p>

<p id="64">
See <a href="#install-unix-1">Section 4.0 Notes for installation of Allegro CL on UNIX (including Linux)</a> for more details
on this step.
</p>

<p id="65">
<b>Windows: run the exe file</b>. Double click on it if using the
Windows Explorer or execute it if at a Command Prompt. Follow the
instructions that appear. See
<a href="#install-windows-1">Section 5.0 Installation on Windows</a> for full details.
</p>


</li>

<li id="66">
<b>Copy the license file into [Allegro directory]/devel.lic</b>.  The
license file you obtained in step one above should be copied into the
Allegro directory and its name should be changed to
<i>devel.lic</i>. 
</li>

<li id="67">
<b>Install Emacs off the web (optional)</b>. See
<a href="#install-emacs-1">Section 7.0 Installing Emacs from the web</a> for details.
</li>
<li id="68">
<b>[Windows only] Install OpenSSL libraries if desired and available
(optional)</b>. 
Users interested in writing applications using secure
sockets may wish to install the OpenSSL libraries. See
<a href="#install-openssl-1">Section 8.0 Installing OpenSSL libraries on Windows</a> for instructions and
more details. OpenSSL libraries need installation only for
Windows. (Version 8.2 comes with a new version of OpenSSL which must
be installed even if you have the older version (distributed with 8.1
and earlier) installed.)
</li>

<li id="69">
<b>Run sys:update-allegro</b>: patches (correcting bugs or providing
new features) are released for Allegro CL regularly. For normal usage,
we recommend that you update regularly, including immediately after
installation. Do this by starting Lisp and evaluating
<code>(sys:update-allegro)</code>. See <a href="operators/system/update-allegro.htm"><b>sys:update-allegro</b></a> and also <a href="introduction.htm#patches-2">Patches</a> in

<p id="83">
Security-Enhanced Linux, or SELinux is a feature that is available on
many modern versions of Linux and is enabled by default on some. It
affects the way shared libraries are loaded and that can prevent
Allegro CL from starting up. The error you will likely see is
something like:
</p>

<pre id="84">

contributed files (about 3300 Kbytes). By default, the first two are
included and the third left out. 
<p id="109">
If you do not install either the Allegro CL documentation and the ANSI
spec, shortcuts relating to documentation on the Allegro CL menu item
on the Start menu will link you to versions on the Franz Inc. web
site. (However, if you have the space, it is best to include the
documentation.) If you include the Allegro CL documentation but not
the ANSI spec, links from the Allegro CL documentation to the ANSI
spec will not work.

<hr><h2 id="122"><a name="windows-testing-2">5.1 Testing that the installation of Allegro CL on Windows was successful</a></h2>

<p id="123">
We will test the installation by starting Allegro CL from the menu.
You should see an `Allegro CL
8.2' item on the Programs submenu of the Start menu.
(`Allegro CL 8.2 Free Express Edition' for the Express Edition
and `Allegro CL 8.2 Student Edition' for Student.) That item
has a submenu, with (among other items) submenus <b>Modern ACL
Images</b> and <b>ANSI ACL Images</b>. We will start a Modern ACL with
the IDE in this example. The Express does not have submenus for
images, since only one is supplied (there are submenus for other
things).

(or <b>Start | Programs | Allegro CL
8.2 Free Express Edition | Allegro CL
8.2 Free Express Edition</b> or <b>Start | Programs | Allegro CL
8.2 Student Edition | Allegro CL

a splash window and then a window titled `Allegro Common Lisp
Console'. Shortly thereafter, the Allegro CL
Integrated Development Environment windows appear, typically starting
with some dialogs which you must resond to or dismiss (dismissing is
okay). After everything is started, your screen will have various
windows, including the Debug (i.e. Listener) window shown here:
</p>
<p id="127"><img src="pictures/debug.jpg"></p>

<p id="128">
One of the dialogs that may appear, if you have worked on projects in
the IDE in earlier sessions, is the
<a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/startup-dialog.htm">Startup Action</a>
dialog, which asks if you want to open one of these recent
projects. (We do not show it because we are assuming you have just
installed Allegro CL. Note the Express edition does not have a startup
dialog.)

You may now either exit Allegro CL by
choosing <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/file-menu.htm#exit">File | Exit</a> (that is, the

<hr><hr><h2 id="132"><a name="macosx-install-1">6.0 Installation on Mac OS X</a></h2>

<p id="133">
Allegro CL on Mac OS X is distributed both as a
<b>.dmg</b> file and as a <b>.bz2</b> file. You may install using the <b>.dmg</b> as described in this section, or using the <b>.bz2</b>, as described in 
<a href="#install-steps-1">Section 3.0 Installation steps</a>. If you are using CLIM
or the IDE, you must install X11 and associated tools, as described
in <a href="#macosx-x11-2">Section 6.1 Installing X11, GTK, and Open Motif on Mac OS X</a>. The rest of this
section assumes you are installing with the <b>.dmg</b> file.
</p>
<p id="134">
The <b>.dmg</b> file for Allegro CL 8.2 is called
<b>acl82.dmg</b>. If you use CLIM or the
IDE,  you will need
X11, GTK (for the IDE only), and Open Motif (for CLIM only -- note a
different version than the one used for
8.1). See <a href="#macosx-x11-2">Section 6.1 Installing X11, GTK, and Open Motif on Mac OS X</a> for instructions
on installing those tools (or just install Allegro CL and continue to
the subsection on installing X11, GTK, and Open Motif).
</p>
<p id="135">
Allegro CL requires Mac OS X 10.5 or later.
</p>
<p id="136">
This is how to install Allegro CL on the Mac:
</p>

<ol>
<li id="137">

<b>Download the file to the local hard disk.</b>

</li>
<li id="138">

<b>Double-click on the image</b>.  It will open the <b>.dmg</b> file
and mount the disk image.  Inside there is a single directory, called
AllegroCL or
AllegroCL64, depending on which version they have, 32 or
64-bit.

</li>
<li id="139">

<b>Copy the directory to the desired location</b>. The
AllegroCL or
AllegroCL64 directory can be copied (by clicking and
dragging) anywhere.

</li>
</ol>

<p id="140">
That's all there is to the installation.  Just click and drag it
somewhere.  Of course, <b>/Applications</b> is a good location to use,
if you don't know where to put it. It will run from
anywhere.

<p id="224">
For customers with an Enterprise license (or above), Allegro CL
supports the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol, as described in
<a href="socket.htm#ssl-1">Secure Socket Layer
(SSL)</a> in <a href="socket.htm">socket.htm</a>. The OpenSSL
libraries are necessary to make use of this facility. For all UNIX
platforms (that is, all platforms except Windows), the libraries are
part of the standard Allegro CL distribution and no special
installation is required. For Windows, however, an extra installation
step is required.
</p>


<p id="225">
The Allegro directory contains the file
<i>openssl.exe</i>. This is a self-extracting executable
containing the necessary SSL libraries and files. You must
install or reinstall if you have not installed them since getting
releasae 8.2 as 8.2 uses a later version than 8.1 and earlier. Since a
different directory name is used, you need not uninstall earlier
versions.
</p>


<p id="226">
To install the libraries run <b>openssl.exe</b> and select a location
with at least 3 megabytes of free space (the default location is
<i>c:\openssl-0.9.8l\</i> -- note the last character is
the letter 'l').
</p>
<p id="227">
Next run the System program in the Control Panel and edit your PATH
environment variable to include the directory where you installed the
openssl libraries, so if you installed in the default location, add
<i>c:\openssl-0.9.8l</i> (again, note the last character
is the letter 'l'). Put this first in the PATH list (incorrect files
may be found if you put the location elsewhere).

<p id="229">
Allegro CL comes with various add-on products, such as the CLIM
windowing system and Orblink. Some require additional licenses. Others
are available to all users. All material needed for these products is
in the distribution. Only the license file determines
whether products can be used or not. Contact your Franz Inc. Account
Manager for information on licensing.
</p>

<hr><hr><h2 id="230"><a name="license-file-1">10.0 Getting a license file</a></h2>



<p id="231">
You must have a license file to use Allegro CL and its associated
products. The license file is not included with the distribution.
</p>

<p id="232">
Professional and Enterprise customers with current maintenance
agreements should have received an email message from Franz Inc. with
instructions on how to obtain their license file. Express Edition
customers should receive such an email after providing the necessary
information to Franz Inc. (usually by filling in a form on the Franz
Inc. web site, www.franz.com).
</p>
<p id="233">
The email sent by Franz Inc. gives an URL from which the license file
can be retrieved. The email is in Mime format, with plain text and
HTML versions. If you are able to read mail in a mime-enabled client,
you will be able to click on the URL immediately.
</p>
<p id="234">
You should retrieve the license as soon as you receive the email even
if you have not downloaded the software. Then the license file will be
ready when you install Allegro CL. The name of the file when it is put
in the Allegro directory must be
<i>devel.lic</i>. However, you may use any name when
retrieving, renaming when you copy it to the Allegro directory later.
</p>
<p id="235">
The license file is a text file which includes encrypted text. See
<a href="startup.htm#license-file-1">The Allegro CL
license file</a> in <a href="startup.htm">startup.htm</a> for a sample
(with the encrypted text much and obviously modified).

<p id="236">
If you upgrade your license or purchase add-on products, you will be

<p id="239">
In order to get source code (if your license allows it), you must
return the source code license addendum included with the
distribution. When that addendum is received, you will be sent a new
license which allows installing source code. (Some sources are free to
licensed customers and others are provided for an additional
charge. If you have questions about getting source code, please
<a href="introduction.htm#contacting-fi-1">contact your
Account Manager</a>.)
</p>
<p id="240">
The sources available are:
</p>
<ul>
<li id="241">
<b>Lisp</b>: The Lisp sources to basic Common Lisp and CLOS, plus many
Allegro provided features (jLinker, regexp v2, etc) and Common
Graphics, the IDE, and DDE on Windows. No compiler or runtime system
is provided.
</li>


<li id="242">
<b>AODBC</b>: v2 Lisp sources.
</li>

<li id="243">
<b>MYSQL</b>: sources for Allegro MySQL (see
<a href="mysql.htm">mysql.htm</a>).
</li>
<li id="244">
<b>ORACLE</b>: sources for Allegro Oracle Direct interface (see
<a href="oracle-interface.htm">oracle-interface.htm</a>).
</li>
<li id="245">
<b>CLIM</b>: Lisp sources to all of CLIM.
</li>
<li id="246">
<b>ORBLink</b>: the entire sources to ORBLink (all in Lisp).
</li>
</ul>

<p id="247">
To install sources, do the following:
</p>


<ol>
<li id="248">
<b>On Windows</b>, open the Windows Explorer.
</li>
<li id="249"><b>On Windows</b>, find the Allegro directory in the explorer (it
is typically 
 but you may have chosen
a different directory).
<br>

<strong>On UNIX</strong>, <strong>cd</strong> to the Allegro directory
(it is typically

but you may have chosen a different directory) in a shell.
</li>
<li id="250">
<b>On Windows</b>, double-click on the files <em>srclisp.bat</em> (and
also, if appropriate <i>srcclim.bat</i>,
<i>srcaodbc.bat</i>, <i>srcmysql.bat</i>,
<i>srcoracle.bat</i>,
and <i>srcorblink.bat</i>). Note that the CG and IDE
sources are unpacked by <i>srclisp.bat</i>.
<br>

<strong>On UNIX</strong>, run <i>./srclisp.sh</i> (and
also, if appropriate <i>./srcclim.sh</i>,
<i>./srcaodbc.sh</i>,
<i>./srcmysql.sh</i>,
<i>./srcoracle.sh</i>, and
<i>./srcorblink.sh</i>).
</li>
</ol>

<p id="251">
Assuming you have the new license with the source code module
included, the encrypted source files in the <em>src/</em> directory
should be unencrypted and expanded so the source code will be located

Information on Allegro CL Express
</h2>
<p id="278">
The Express Edition, available for Windows, FreeBSD, Linux, and Mac OS
X (for Intel processors), is provided free of charge so that potential
users may gain experience using Allegro CL and some add-ons before
purchasing.  The Express Edition is fully described on the Franz
Inc. web site (<a href="http://www.franz.com">www.franz.com</a>, click
on the <b>Download</b> button to see information about Express
software). That information may be updated more frequently than the
information here. If there is a conflict between the information on
the Web site and the information given here, the information on the
Web site is correct.
</p>
<p id="279">
CLIM and Allegro Composer are not available with Allegro CL Express.
</p>
<p id="280">
To obtain an Express Edition, you fill out an information form on the
Franz Inc. web site. Then, on Windows, you download a self-installing
executable while on UNIX and UNIX-like platforms, you download a
compressed file which does the installation when uncompressed. On both
Windows and UNIX, the installation also obtains the license file
needed to run the software (you must be connected to the internet
during installation).
</p>
<p id="281">
The Express Edition is not available on a CD. It must be
downloaded. The Windows version does not include the documentation
(but instead links to the documentation on the Web site).
</p>

<hr><h2 id="282"><a name="express-license-2">12.1 Information on the Express license</a></h2>

<p id="283">
Because there were many problems with downloading license files (many
associated with firewalls, proxies, and the like), we have a new
license scheme: you get a license with the download and that license
is good until January 31, 2012. We expect to have a new version of
Express by that time, but if not we will make a new license available.
</p>







<hr><h2 id="284"><a name="express-linux-ide-2">12.2 Running the IDE in Allegro CL 8.2 Express on Linux</a></h2>

<p id="285">
To use the IDE on Linux, just as on Windows, you invoke the allegro or
allegro-express executable. The associated image includes the IDE and
starts it when Allegro CL is started. You do this also with Allegro CL
Express on Linux on x86 processors.
</p>
<p id="286">
But in Allegro CL Professional and Enterprise, you can also start a
non-IDE image (alisp or mlisp) and load the IDE and call <a href="operators/ide/start-ide.htm"><b>ide:start-ide</b></a> (as described in
<a href="cgide.htm">cgide.htm</a>). This second method does not work in
Allegro CL Express Edition. To use the IDE, you must use the
<b>allegro-express</b> executable/image.
</p>
<p id="287">
Thus, you start Allegro CL in Emacs with the Emacs function
<b>fi:common-lisp</b> (see <a href="startup.htm#acl-as-emacs-subprocess-1">Running Lisp as a subprocess of
Emacs</a> in <a href="startup.htm">startup.htm</a>). When you are asked
for the <b>Executable Image Name</b>, specify <b>allegro</b> (for a
case-sensitive, modern image) or <b>allegro-ansi</b> (for a
case-insensitive ANSI image). The IDE will start when Allegro CL
does. 
</p>



<hr><h2 id="288"><a name="express-images-2">12.3 Creating additional Express Edition images on Windows</a></h2>

<p id="289">
To make the downloadable file as small as possible, on Windows we have
only included one Allegro CL image, <b>allegro-express.exe</b>, one that
includes the IDE and is in International "ANSI" mode (case insensitive
upper, as opposed to case sensitive lower of "Modern" images).
</p>
<p id="290">
The other images which are commonly found in an Allegro CL
installation are:
</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td width="20%">
<b>mlisp</b>
</td>
<td width="80%">
Modern base Lisp image, international (16-bit characters)
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="20%">
<b>alisp</b>
</td>
<td width="80%">
ANSI base Lisp image, international (16-bit characters)
</td>

<tr>
<td width="20%">
<b>allegro</b>
</td>
<td width="80%">
Modern IDE image, international (16-bit characters)
</td>

<tr>

<b>alisp8</b>
</td>

<hr><h2 id="297"><a name="student-installation-2">13.1 Information on installing the Student Edition</a></h2>



<p id="298">
Here are the installation steps for the student Edition in brief:
</p>

<ol>
<li id="299">
<b>Get the license file</b>. See
<a href="#license-file-1">Section 10.0 Getting a license file</a>. You can install
without getting a license file but you cannot use the product without
a license file. 
</li>
<li id="300">
<b>Download the software</b>. Information on downloading should have
been sent to you when you purchased the Student Edition. 
If you bought a FreeBSD or Linux version, the files



<b>acl82_student.bz2</b> and, if necessary, the
<b>bunzip2</b> decompression program will be downloaded.   If
you bought the Mac OS X version, one file, <b>acl82_student.dmg</b> is
downloaded. If you bought the Windows version, the
self-extracting executable file 


<b>acl82_student.exe</b> will be downloaded.  Here we assume the files
for FreeBSD and Linux will be downloaded into the
<b><i>/usr/tmp/</i></b> directory, the file for Mac OS X onto the
desktop, and the file for Windows will be downloaded into the
<b><i>c:\temp\</i></b> folder.

</li>
<li id="301">

<b>Decide where you wish to install the Allegro Directory.</b> On
UNIX, the typical location is
 
 
 
<i>/usr/local/acl82_student/</i>. 
On Windows, the
typical location is 



<i>C:\Program Files\acl82-student\</i>.
However, you can choose any location
you like.
</li>


<li id="302">
<b>Linux and FreeBSD: uncompress and untar the distribution file.</b> 
Enter this
command in <b><i>/usr/tmp/</i></b> (or wherever the downloaded files
are):



<pre id="303">
% ./bunzip2 &lt; acl82_student.bz2 | (cd /usr/local; tar xf -)
</pre>


<p id="304">
<b>Mac OS X: run the dmg file</b>. Find the <b>acl82_student.dmg</b>
image and double click on it.  It will open the dmg file and mount the
disk image.
</p>

<p id="305">
<b>Windows: run the exe file</b>. Double click on it
if using the Windows Explorer. Execute it if at a Command Prompt or a
DOS prompt. Follow the instructions that appear.
</p>

</li>

<li id="306">

<b>Copy the license file into [Allegro directory]/devel.lic</b>.  The
license file you obtained in step one above should be copied into the
Allegro directory and its name should be changed to
<i>devel.lic</i>. 
</li>

<li id="307">
<b>Install Emacs off the web (optional)</b>. See
<a href="#install-emacs-1">Section 7.0 Installing Emacs from the web</a> for details.
</li>
<li id="308">
<b>Start Lisp and run sys:update-allegro</b>: patches (correcting bugs
or providing new features) are released for Allegro CL regularly. For
normal usage, we recommend that you update regularly, including
immediately after installation. Do this by starting Lisp and
evaluating <code>(sys:update-allegro)</code>. See <a href="operators/system/update-allegro.htm"><b>sys:update-allegro</b></a> and also
<a href="introduction.htm#patches-2">Patches</a> in
<a href="introduction.htm">introduction.htm</a>.
</li>

<p id="309">
If you get an error when starting Allegro CL on Linux, it may be the
SELinux problem. See <a href="#selinux-2">Section 4.1 Allegro CL may have problems starting up when run on SELinux</a> for more
information.

<p id="310">
Somewhat more verbose instructions are available in

</p>




<hr><hr><h2 id="311"><a name="cds-1">14.0 Distribution on CDs</a></h2>

<p id="312">
While it is always best to download the software (because the download
version will be the latest available), regular customers can request
the distribution on a CD. The installation instructions are the same
except you typically install from a directory on the CD rather than
from the location of the downloaded files. Additional instructions
will be sent with the CD.
