<p id="4">
This function is not available in all versions. Generally, you must
have an Enterprise license to use this function. Also, you must have
the OpenSSL libraries installed for this facility to work. Note that
shared library versions of the OpenSSL libraries (required by Allegro
CL) are not available on all platforms. The SSL functionality is in
the <i>ssl</i> module. To ensure it is loaded, evaluate
<code>(require :ssl)</code>. Calling this function automatically
loads the module.
</p>
<p id="5">
This function creates and returns a new SSL client socket stream that
communicates using SSL via the given socket. Once this function is
called and an SSL socket stream is returned, no I/O calls should be
done directly to <i>socket</i>. Note that closing the
SSL socket stream will result in the original socket file descriptor
being closed as well.  Therefore, the idiomatic way to establish an
SSL client socket stream is:
</p>
<pre id="6">
  ;; SOCK is already a socket:
  (setf sock (make-ssl-client-stream sock ...))
</pre>
<p id="7">
Unless <a href="ssl-do-handshake.htm"><b>ssl-do-handshake</b></a> is called, the secure
connection isn't negotiated until the first byte is sent through the
SSL socket stream to the underlying stream (and this will usually
occur when the first <a href="../../../ansicl/dictentr/finish-o.htm"><b>force-output</b></a> is done to the SSL socket
stream). Calling <a href="ssl-do-handshake.htm"><b>ssl-do-handshake</b></a> causes the secure
connection to be negotiated immediately.
</p>
<p id="8">
When that first write is done a negotiation process is begun that
involves reads and writes. This negotiation process will not occur if
the SSL socket on the other end of the connection is not sitting waiting
for data to arrive. Thus if you create two connected sockets in a
single Lisp process, and make one the client and the other the server,
and then write to the client side the Lisp will hang since the server
side socket isn't being read.  You can make this work if you use the Lisp
multiprocessing facility (see <a href="../../multiprocessing.htm">multiprocessing.htm</a>)
to cause the server socket to be read at the same time that the write
to the client socket is being done.

<h3 id="9">
The keyword arguments
</h3>
<p id="10">
<a href="make-ssl-client-stream.htm"><b>make-ssl-client-stream</b></a>'s keyword
arguments are the same as <a href="make-ssl-server-stream.htm"><b>make-ssl-server-stream</b></a>'s. The
keyword arguments to <a href="make-ssl-client-stream.htm"><b>make-ssl-client-stream</b></a> are:
</p>
<ul>
<li id="11">


<b><i>method</i></b> allows control
over the SSL protocol handshake process. Supported SSL protocols are
SSLv2, SSLv3, and TLSv1, from oldest to
newest. The <i>method</i> keyword argument can be:
<ul>
<li id="12">
<code>:sslv23</code> (the default): the client will initiate SSL
handshake using SSLv2 and will advertise that it can handle SSLv2,
SSLv3, and TLSv1. The highest protocol version that is common between
the client and server will be selected. This method allows for best
compatibility.
</li>
<li id="13">
<code>:sslv2</code>: the client will initiate SSL handshake using
SSLv2 and will advertise that it can only speak SSLv2.  This option is
not recommended as SSLv2 has known security issues (such as
susceptibility to man In the middle attacks).
</li>
<li id="14">
<code>:sslv3</code>: the client will initiate SSL handshake using
SSLv3 and will advertise that it can only speak SSLv3.
</li>
<li id="15">
<code>:sslv3+</code>: this is the same as :sslv23 except that,
after handshake, if the selected protocol is SSLv2, an error will be
generated.  This option allows for high handshake compabitility while
avoiding communication under the deprecated SSLv2 protocol.
</li>
<li id="16">
<code>:tlsv1</code>: the client will initiate SSL handshake using
TLSv1 and will advertise that it can only speak TLSv1.
</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li id="17">

<b><i>certificate</i></b> names a file which contains
one or more PEM-encoded certificates.  The first (or only) certificate
in the file will be used to identify the client (in the case of
<a href="make-ssl-client-stream.htm"><b>make-ssl-client-stream</b></a>) or server (in
the case of <a href="make-ssl-server-stream.htm"><b>make-ssl-server-stream</b></a>).  Optionally,
subsequent entries in the file may be used to supply intermediate CA
certificates (also known as a certificate chain).

</li>
<li id="18">

The <b><i>key</i></b> argument is a string or pathname
naming a file containing the private RSA key corresponding the the
public key in the certificate. The file must be in PEM format. The key
can be stored in an encrypted form which requires a pass phrase
to read, but in that case the
<i>certificate-password</i> must also be specified. If
the key is stored in the certificate file, then you needn't specify
the <i>key</i> argument.

</li>
<li id="19">

The <b><i>certificate-password</i></b> argument, if
specified, should be a string. If the private key stored with the
certificate inside the file named by the
<i>certificate</i> argument is encrypted, then this
value is used as the key to decrypt it.

</li>
<li id="20">

<b><i>verify</i></b> can be <code>nil</code>, <code>:optional</code>, or
<code>:required</code>.  Due to the way OpenSSL is implemented,
the behavior of peer verification differs for clients and
servers. Here we describe the behavior for clients. See <a href="make-ssl-server-stream.htm"><b>make-ssl-server-stream</b></a> for a
discussion of the server behavior.

<ul>
<li id="21">

<b>:verify nil</b> means that no automatic verification will occur on
the server-supplied certificate.  Manual verification can be done
using <a href="get-ssl-peer-certificate.htm"><b>get-ssl-peer-certificate</b></a> and <a href="get-ssl-verify-result.htm"><b>get-ssl-verify-result</b></a>.

</li>
<li id="22">

<b>:verify :optional</b> means that the server's certificate (if
supplied) will be automatically verified during SSL handshake.  If
verification fails, an error will be generated during SSL handshake.

</li>
<li id="23">

<b>:verify :required</b> means that the server's certificate will be
automatically verified during SSL handshake.  If the server does not
supply a certificate or if verification of the supplied certificate
fails, an error will be generated during SSL handshake.

</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li id="24">

<b><i>maxdepth</i></b> must be an integer (which
defaults to 10) which indicates the maximum allowable depth of the
certificate verification chain.  If the chain exceeds this depth, an
error will be generated during SSL handshake.

</li>
<li id="25">

<b><i>ca-file</i></b> specifies the name of a file
containing a series of trusted PEM-encoded Intermediate CA or Root CA
certificates that will be used during peer certificate verification.
A file containing certificates of well-known root CAs can be found in
<b>[acl directory]/examples/ssl/ca-bundle.crt</b>.

</li>
<li id="26">

<b><i>ca-directory</i></b> specifies the name of a
directory containing a series of trusted Intermediate CA or Root CA
certificate files that will be used during peer certificate
verification.  Each file in the directory should contain one
certificate.  The files should be named based on the hash value of the
certificate subject name.  If more than one certificate with the same
hash value exists, the extension must be different (e.g. 9d66eef0.0,
9d66eef0.1 etc). The search is performed in the ordering of the
extension number, regardless of other properties of the certificates.
Use the <b>c_rehash</b> (available via standard OpenSSL distributions)
utility to create the necessary links.

</li>

<li id="27">
<b><i>ciphers</i></b>: if
the <i>ciphers</i> keyword argument is supplied, it must
be a string which specifies an OpenSSL cipher list. The list is
advertised to the SSL server during handshake. From that list, the
SSL server will select a cipher to use for subsequent communications.
If the SSL server does not support any of the ciphers in the list, SSL
handshake will fail and an error will be generated.
<p id="28">
For details on the cipher list format, see the CIPHER LIST FORMAT
section of <a href="http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html" target="_blank">http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html</a>.
