convert the resulting date-time instances.
</p>
<p id="10">
Specifically, the datetime module does the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li id="11">
Defines classes that represent points of time (dates and times of
day), time durations, and time intervals.
</li>
<li id="12">
Provides parsing tools that create date-time instances of these

<hr><hr><h2 id="14"><a name="iso-8601-1">2.0 ISO 8601</a></h2>

<p id="15">
ISO 8601 is an international standard for representing dates in the
Gregorian calendar and times and representations of periods of times.
(There are descriptions in a number of places. See, for example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia
Encyclopedia</a>, where you will find additional links. This essay was
adapted from that Wikipedia article -- see
<a href="#copyleft-1">Section 9.0 Copyright notice</a>.)
</p>
<p id="16">
ISO 8601 specifies formats for specifying dates (see
<a href="#iso-8601-dates-2">Section 2.1 ISO 8601 dates</a>) and times (see
<a href="#iso-8601-times-2">Section 2.2 ISO 8601 times</a>). 
</p>
<p id="17">
All dates use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar">Gregorian
Calendar</a>, the calendar currently in use almost everywhere on
earth, even dates prior to the implementation of the Gregorian
Calendar on 15 October 1582. This means that the ISO 8601 date for an
event prior to 15 October 1582 will very likely be different from the
common specification of that date, and certainly be different from
contemporary specifications of that date. (Thus, 14 October 1582 is a
valid ISO 8601 date, but there was no such date in areas that accepted
the Gregorian Calendar because that was when the adjustment of 10 days
was made.
</p>
<p id="18">
Also, ISO 8601 specifies that there was a year 0 while most references
to BCE (Before Common Era) years assume there was no year 0. Thus
Caesar invaded Britain in 44 BCE by most accounts but 43 BCE in ISO
8601.
</p>
<p id="19">
These details are important for understanding and using ISO 8601,
particularly for pre-modern dates, but we will not discuss them
further here. Follow the links to discussions of ISO 8601 above to
find out more about its definitions and background.

In the rest of this essay, we discuss the implementation and interface
to ISO 8601 dates in Allegro CL.

<hr><h2 id="21"><a name="iso-8601-dates-2">2.1 ISO 8601 dates</a></h2>


<p id="22">
An ISO 8601 description of a date can be as a 
</p>
<ul>
<li id="23">
<b>Calendar date</b>
</li>
<li id="24">
<b>Week date</b>
</li>
<li id="25">
<b>Ordinal date</b>
</li>
</ul>

<p id="26">
A <b>Calendar date</b> is written as YYYY-MM-DD (extended) or YYYYMMDD
(basic).  YYYY indicates a year with century.  MM indicates the month
of the year (01 through 12).  DD indicates the day of that month (01
through 31).  Examples: "19850412" and "1985-04-12" denote the same
date: the 12th of April in 1985.
</p>
<p id="27">
A <b>Week date</b> is written as YYYY-Www-D (extended) or YYYYWwwD
(basic).  YYYY indicates a year, ww indicates a week number (01
through 53 -- the <b>W</b> is the letter W), and D is the weekday
number (1 through 7).  Monday is 1, Sunday is 7.  Week 01 is the week
with the year's first Thursday in it.  Examples: "1985-W15-5" is the
fifth day of the week containing the fifteenth Thursday of the year
1985.  This happens to be equivalent to the 12th of April in 1985
(1985-04-12).
</p>
<p id="28">
Note that the week year can be different than the normal (Gregorian)
year for dates at the end or start of the ordinary year.  For
example, "2008-12-29" is written as "2009-W01-1".
</p>
<p id="29">
An <b>Ordinal date</b> is written as YYYY-DDD (extended) or YYYYDDD
(basic).  YYYY indicates a year, and DDD is the ordinal day in the
year.  For example, the date representing "1985-04-12" can also be
written "1985-102".
</p>
<p id="30">
ISO 8601 describes possible reduced precision and truncated date
representations.  For example, YYYY-MM is used to specify a month.
Also, YY-MM-DD is used to specify a date in an implied century.
</p>
<p id="31">
It is also possible to represent negative years or years greater than
9999.  However, the Lisp datetime module parser needs to know that
extra year digits are being used parsed to avoid ambiguities.
</p>



<hr><h2 id="32"><a name="iso-8601-times-2">2.2 ISO 8601 times</a></h2>

<p id="33">
An ISO 8601 description of a time is HH:MM:SS (extended) or HHMMSS
(basic).  A 24-hour clock is used.  Fractions may also be used with
the time elements.  For example, "14 hours, 30 and one half minutes"
can be represented as "14:30.5" or "14:30,5" (that is, either a period
or a comma may be used as the fraction separator).
</p>
<p id="34">
An ISO 8601 description of a time zone is &lt;time&gt;Z or
&lt;time&gt; followed by a plus (+) or minus (-) followed by HH:MM
(extended) or HHMM (basic).  The number is the offset from
UTC. (<b>UTC</b> is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time">Coordinated
Universal Time</a>, also called Greenwich Mean Time.)
</p>
<p id="35">
An ISO 8601 description of a date-time combination is
&lt;date&gt;T&lt;time&gt;.  For example, 1985-04-12T23:20:50+02:00 is
23:20:50 on 1985-04-12 in the time zone that is 2 hours ahead of UTC.
</p>
<p id="36">
Note that the Lisp datetime module allows a single space to be used
in place of T to separate &lt;date&gt; and &lt;time&gt;.
</p>

The datetime Lisp module provides functions, <a href="operators/date-time/date-time-to-ut.htm"><b>date-time-to-ut</b></a> and <a href="operators/date-time/ut-to-date-time.htm"><b>ut-to-date-time</b></a>, that
convert date-time instances holding both a date and a time to/from the
associated Common Lisp universal-time (a number).  Since ISO 8601 allows
for dates/times to be specified outside the range of those
representable by universal-time (i.e., dates before 1900, or times
containing fractional seconds), an extended universal-time is used.
This extended universal-time allows for negative values to represent
dates before 1900.  In addition, extended universal-times can be
non-integer rationals representing times with fractional seconds.

<h3 id="74">
Duration addition and subtraction are not inverse operations
</h3>

<p id="75">
Adding durations of days, hours, minutes, and seconds to a date-time
is an unambiguous operations, but adding months (often) and years
(sometimes) is more problematic. 
</p>
<p id="76">
Consider a Month/Day: adding a month should result in (+ Month
1)/Day. That definition is fine when there is a (+ Month 1)/Day but
often there isn't. This Adding a month to April 4 gives May 4, and a
month to June 30 gives July 30. But what about adding a month to May
31? There is no June 31. The result could be July 1, but June 30 seems
to make more sense (it would be uninitutive for the addition of one
month to result in the Month value increasing by 2). ISO 8601 does not
address this point. Allegro CL follows the XML schema behavior, which
follows this rule:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="77">
<b>The addition of one month result in the month value being increased
by 1 (mod 12) and the day value being unchanged, unless the day does
not exist in the new month, in which case the day value is the largest
possible for the new month (i.e. the last day of the month).</b>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="78">
But following that rule results duration addition and subtraction not
being inverse operations. For example, adding <b>1 month</b> to
<code>May 31</code> yields <code>June 30</code>, but
subtracting <b>1 month</b> from <code>June 30</code> yields
<code>May 30</code>, and <i>not</i> <code>May 31</code>.
</p>

<h4 id="79">
Example <a href="#example-preamble">[assumes the current package uses the
util.date-time package]</a>
</h4>

<pre id="80">
;; Here we use January 31, in a leap year:

 &gt; (setq one-month (time-interval-duration (time-interval &quot;P1M&quot;)))
 #&lt;duration 0Y1M0DT0H0M0S @ ...&gt;

 &gt; (setq dt (add-duration (date-time &quot;19840131&quot;) one-month))
 #&lt;date-time &quot;1984-02-29&quot; @ ...&gt;

 &gt; (subtract-duration dt one-month)
 #&lt;date-time &quot;1984-01-29&quot; @ ...&gt;

;; Note that adding one month to January 31 (in a leap year) 
;; produced February 29, and subtracting one month from that 
;; produced January 29, not January 31.

;; The same point is made with this example (using August 31):

 &gt; (subtract-duration
        (add-duration (date-time &quot;--0831&quot;) one-month)
        one-month)
 #&lt;date-time &quot;--08-30&quot; @ ...&gt;
</pre>

<p id="81">
The same problem occurs with years, but only with leap years. February
29, 1984, or 1984/02/29, plus one year is February 28, 1985, or
1985/02/28 (as Februaru 29, 1985 does not exist). 1985/02/28 minus one
year is 1984/02/28, not 1984/02/29.
</p>
<p id="82">
Duration addition and subtraction restricted to weeks, days, hours,
minutes, and second are inverse operations because there is never any
ambiguity about what adding or subtracting those values gives.
</p>
<p id="83">
(The problem arises becaus duration addition for months and years are
not a one-to-one functions. One month plus 1985/01/31, 1985/01/30,
1985/01/29, and 1985/01/28 all give 1985/02/28, so 1985/02/28 minus
one month is necessarily ambiguous. This ambiguity is inherent: there
is no definition of "adding one month" other than "always adding a
specific number (31?) of days regardless of the starting month" that
will not be ambiguous. But addition of days, hours, minutes, and
second is always one to one and so always invertable.)
</p>

<h4 id="84">
Duration addition is not associative
</h4>
<p id="85">
One consequence of the fact that adding a month or year is defined to
keep the same day in the new month if possible, otherwise use the last
day of the month is that duration addition is not associative: a
date-time plus one month plus one month need not be the same as the
date-time plus two months: (August 31 plus 2 months in October
31. August 31 plus one month is September 30, which plus one month is
October 30. Similarly, February 29, 1984 plus four years is February
29, 1988, while February 29, 1984 plus two years in February 28, 1986,
which plus two years is February 28, 1988.
