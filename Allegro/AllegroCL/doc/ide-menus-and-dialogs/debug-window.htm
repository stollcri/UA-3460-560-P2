<p id="3">
The Debug window contains a listener (with a prompt) where you can
enter and evaluate Lisp forms. It also displays debugging information
after an error (<a href="debug-window-after-error.htm">click here</a>
to see the
description of the Debug window after an error). Here is the Debug
window when there is no error being debugged:
</p>
<p id="4"><img src="../pictures/debug.jpg"></p>
<p id="5">
The prompt is a 
<code>[current package](Number)</code>.
You can type directly to the prompt, pressing Enter
for a newline. If you have entered a complete Lisp expression,
pressing Enter evaluates it and the returned value is printed below
the entered form. If you have not entered a complete expression,
pressing Enter places the cursor on the next line, suitably indented,
waiting for more input.
</p>
<p id="6">
There are various ways to repeat an already typed expression.  One
quick way is to place the text cursor anywhere within an expression
visible in the listener pane and then press ENTER. This will copy the
whole evaluated expression to the end of the listener's text (either
to the prompt or after any text already entered at the
prompt). You can quickly move the text cursor to various
previously-evaluated forms by holding down the Control and Alt keys
and pressing the up and down arrow keys (this also works without the
Control key, though on Windows that can trigger functionality for
inserting special characters that's built into Microsoft
widget).
</p>
<p id="7">
You can also use the history dropping outline to retrieve an already
entered expression.
</p>
<p id="8">
The dropping outline to the right under the title bar displays the
history of entered Lisp expressions, with the most recent visible.
Both expressions which were evaluated and those which were entered and
not evaluated (because, e.g., the New Prompt button was clicked before
evaluation) appear in the list. Clicking on an item in this drop-down
list will paste the expression at the listener's prompt, ready to be
evaluated again (after optionally editing it).  Clicking the blue
arrow at the left of an expression will show the values that were
returned, each in a separate line (expressions not evaluated have a
gray dot rather than a blue arrow); clicking one of these values will
return the value, leaving the variable <a href="../../ansicl/dictentr/unnamed.htm"><b>*</b></a> bound to the value for further
use. Expressions in the history drop-down list may also be manipulated
more quickly with the keyboard shortcuts for some of the buttons to
the left of the drop-down list; see below for details.
</p>

<p id="9">
To instead copy a sub-expression of an earlier evaluation to the
prompt, hold down the control key and left-click in or next to the
expression.  Clicking just before an opening parenthesis or just after
the corresponding closing parenthesis will copy a list expression that
starts or ends with that parenthesis; similarly, clicking just before
an opening double-quote character or just after a closing double-quote
character will copy a string; otherwise, clicking anywhere on a "word"
(a character sequence demarcated by parentheses, spaces, tabs, and/or
newlines) will copy that word (such as a symbol or number).
</p>
<p id="10">
The buttons to the left of the dropping outline work as
follows. (Placing the cursor over a button causes the tooltip to
display. We identify the buttons by the tooltip description.)
</p>
<ul>
<li id="11">
<b>New Prompt</b>: click to get a new prompt. Any unprocessed input is
discarded. In certain cases, the listener can become confused about
input. Clicking this button clears that confusion.
</li>

<li id="12">

<b>Complete History Expression</b>: if you start typing at the prompt
and have matched the beginning of an expression in the history,
clicking this button completes the expression. Thus, if you have
earlier evaluated (+ 1.2 3.4), entering (+ 1.2 and pressing this
button completes the expression to match the earlier input. 
If more than one expression matches
what you type, the initial completion is to the most recent. If the
most recent match is not the one you are looking for, then this button
may be pressed multiple times successively to retrieve older matches.
 You are warned if nothing matches your input.

</li>
<li id="13">
<b>The arrows</b> (Back in History and Forward in History): move
forward or back in the history display. Typically you use these keys
to select an earlier expression, and then use either the Paste
button to copy the selected expression to the prompt for editing and
re-evaluation, or the Paste and Evaluate button to re-evaluate the
expression as is. The fastest way to reuse earlier expressions is to
use the keyboard shortcuts for these buttons; the shortcuts are shown
in the button tooltips.
</li>
<li id="14">
<b>Paste and Evaluate</b>: paste the current history expression (the visible
one) to the prompt and evaluate it.
</li>
<li id="15">
<b>Paste</b>: paste the current history expression (the visible one) to the
prompt but do not evaluate.
</li>
<li id="16">
<b>Evaluate</b>: evaluate the expression at the prompt (equivalent to
pressing Enter). If the expression at the prompt is incomplete, go to
the next line, indent appropriately, and wait for further input.
</li>
</ul>

An additional listener pane can be created by choosing <a href="view-menu.htm#new-listener">View | New
Listener</a>.
