<p id="5">
This dialog displays runtime analysis statistics. A runtime analysis
is a collection of data about which functions were being called and
where most of the time was being spent or where the most memory was
being used by the creation of new lisp objects. (See
<a href="../runtime-analyzer.htm">runtime-analyzer.htm</a>.)
</p>
<p id="6">
To start collecting data, either invoke the <a href="run-menu.htm#runtime-analyzer-control">Run | Runtime Analyzer Control |
Start/Resume Sampling</a> command or display the <a href="runtime-analyzer-control-dialog.htm">Runtime
Analyzer Control dialog</a> (by invoking the <a href="run-menu.htm#runtime-analyzer-control">Run | Runtime Analyzer Control
Dialog</a> command) and press its <b>Start Sampling</b>
button. When you feel enough data has been collected, stop data collection
either with <a href="run-menu.htm#runtime-analyzer-control">Run | Runtime Analyzer Control | Stop
Sampling</a> command or the <b>Stop</b> button on the <a href="runtime-analyzer-control-dialog.htm">Runtime
Analyzer Control dialog</a>. Now you are ready to analyze the
data using this dialog.  (Alternately, you can call <a href="../operators/prof/start-profiler.htm"><b>start-profiler</b></a>, <a href="../operators/prof/stop-profiler.htm"><b>stop-profiler</b></a>, and related commands
programmatically, and then display the results on this dialog.)
</p>
<p id="7">
When the dialog is first displayed by the <a href="run-menu.htm#runtime-analyzer-results-dialog">Run | Runtime Analyzer Results
Dialog</a> command, no information is displayed, and so you need
to press the <b>Update</b> button to analyze the current analysis data
and display it here.  Similarly, if a subsequent analysis is
performed, invoking this dialog with the <a href="run-menu.htm#runtime-analyzer-results-dialog">Run | Runtime Analyzer Results
Dialog</a> command will continue to show the currently-analyzed
data until you again press the <b>Update</b> button to analyze the
newer data. (On the other hand, pressing the <b>Show Results</b>
button on the <a href="runtime-analyzer-control-dialog.htm">Runtime Analyzer Control
dialog</a> will automatically update this dialog to show the new
data.)
</p>
<p id="8">
The three tabs summarize the collected data in up to three ways.
Illustrated above is the <b>Outline</b> presentation (onthe Outline
tab), which corresponds to the output from <a href="../operators/prof/show-call-graph.htm"><b>show-call-graph</b></a>, and the <b>Flat</b>
presentation (on the Flat tab), which corresponds to the output from
<a href="../operators/prof/show-flat-profile.htm"><b>show-flat-profile</b></a>.
</p>
<p id="9">
The third tab is the <b>Call</b> Counts presentation,
which corresponds to the output from <a href="../operators/prof/show-call-counts.htm"><b>show-call-counts</b></a>. 
</p>
<p id="10">
(Data was just collected while running the IDE. One usually collects
data when running your application or parts of your application. See
<a href="../runtime-analyzer.htm">runtime-analyzer.htm</a> for discussion of how to use
the runtime analyzer. Here we are only interested in the dialogs and
how they display.)
</p>
<p id="11">
Nodes in the outline presentation indicate functions or methods
called, as do the entries in the left column of the Flat and Call
Counts displays.  The Flat and Call Counts presentations may be sorted
differently by clicking on the column headers.  And (as usual in the
IDE dialogs), the 
<a href="search-menu.htm#find-forward">Search | Find Forward</a> or <a href="search-menu.htm#find-backward">Search |
Find Backward</a> command may be used to search for
arbitrary strings in any of the presentations.
</p>
<a name="graph-button"></a><h3 id="12">The Graph button</h3>
<p id="13">
Clicking the <b>Graph</b> button presents the information from the Outline
presentation as a tree graph. The blue bars on the left side of the
graph nodes indicate the portion of the time spent (or space consed)
in the node's branch as a fraction of the time spent in the parent
node's branch. If the blue bar is as tall as the node itself, that
indicates that 100% of the time in the parent branch was spent in this
branch; a blue bar half as tall as the node indicates that 50% of the
parent branch was spent in this branch.  If there is a green bar, that
indicates the portion of the entire analysis time that was spent in
this node's branch.  The yellow bar on the right side of a node
indicates the portion of that node's branch that was spent within that
node itself, as opposed to its sub-nodes; in other words, the portion
of hits that occurred within that function itself rather than in the
functions that it called.  The yellow bars are not drawn on the leaf
nodes since they would always be the full node height on those nodes.
</p>

<p id="14">
The appearance of nodes on the Windows platform can be controlled with
the configuration options <a href="../operators/ide/use-color-gradients-in-tree-graphs.htm"><b>ide:use-color-gradients-in-tree-graphs</b></a> and
<a href="../operators/ide/use-antialiased-text-in-tree-graphs.htm"><b>ide:use-antialiased-text-in-tree-graphs</b></a>.
</p>

<p id="15">
Similarly, the blue bars are not drawn on "only child" nodes, since
they would also always be the full node height.
</p>
<h3 id="16">The Filter button</h3>
<p id="17">
Press this button to display a dialog showing various types of nodes
to exclude from the outline or graph. This can be useful to
prune a huge number of nodes down to a more manageable set.
Press the <b>Update</b> button after modifying the filter to update
the display to reflect the new filter.
</p>


<h3 id="18">The Save to History button</h3>
<p id="19">
Press this button to allow re-viewing this analysis after further
analyses have been performed (within this IDE session). You will be
asked to enter a name for the analysis, which will be added to the
combo-box list at the top of the dialog. Selecting the name from this
combo-box at some later time will once again display that analysis in
the dialog.
</p>
<h3 id="20">The Save to File button</h3>
<p id="21">
Press this button to save the contents of the currently displayed
analysis to a plain text file. (The <a href="file-menu.htm#save">File | Save</a> command does this as
well when this dialog is selected.) It sometimes may be useful to
send this generated file to Franz with a bug report.
</p>
<p id="22">
The file will contain only the lines are currently visible in the
outline widget, so you may want to open the outline further to reveal
any lines that look interesting before saving to file.  (As usual with
a Common Graphics outline control, you can control-click on the
open/close icon of an <a href="../classes/cg/outline-item.htm"><code>outline-item</code></a> to open all of its descendents, or
type control-rightarrow.)
</p>

<h3 id="23">The right button menu</h3>
<p id="24">
The right-button menu in the Outline view or in a graph
contains special analysis commands, rather than the usual selection of
commands from the menu-bar as in most IDE dialogs. 
</p>
<ul>
<li id="25">
<b>Print Statistics</b>
prints a textual summary of the selected node in the Debug Window.
</li>
<li id="26">
<b>Graph Combined Subtree</b> displays a new
analysis graph consisting of the combined data from all branches of
this graph that start with a node for the method or function
represented by the currently selected node; that is, a graph of
everything called by the currently selected method or function.
Analysis graphs are described <a href="#graph-button">above</a>.
</li>
<li id="27">
<b>Graph Unfiltered Subtree</b> displays a new analysis graph showing
the currently selected branch with no nodes filtered out of it, as if
the Filter button on the Runtime Analyzer Results dialog were used to
filter nothing out.  Analysis graphs are described <a href="#graph-button">above</a>.
</li>
<li id="28">
<b>Graph Subtree</b> displays a new analysis graph showing the
currently selected branch as a subtree. Analysis graphs are described
<a href="#graph-button">above</a>.
</li>
<li id="29">
<b>Disassemble</b> prints the assembly code for the method or function of the
selected node to the Debug Window.  
</li>
<li id="30">
<b>Inspect</b> inspects the actual
analysis node in the IDE inspector.  
</li>
<li id="31">
<b>Quick Find Definition</b>: find the source of the operator at the
selected node, as if with <a href="search-menu.htm#quick-find-definition">Search | Quick Find
Definition</a>.
</li>
<li id="32">
<b>Print</b> will print the entire
analysis outline or graph on multiple pages of hardcopy.
</li>
</ul>
<p id="33">
When a number appears after a method or function name, either in the
outline view or a analysis graph, it is the number of times that that
method or function was called. These numbers will be shown only when
call counts were included in the analysis, and only for the particular
methods or functions that were counted).  If the method or function
appears in more than one branch of the analysis, the number is for the
whole analysis rather than for that particular branch.
</p>
<p id="34">
When the text in a node of an analysis graph is dark blue rather than
black, it indicates that there are additional nodes in the graph for
that method or function, where it was called in other places.  The
commands "Print Statistics" and "Graph Combined Subtree" on the
right-button menu may be particularly useful on these nodes, because
they provide combined information on all of the branches that begin
with that method or function.
