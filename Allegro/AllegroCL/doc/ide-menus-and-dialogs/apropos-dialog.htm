<p id="3"><img src="../pictures/apropos.jpg"></p>
<p id="4">
The Apropos dialog, displayed by clicking <a href="search-menu.htm#apropos">Search |
Apropos</a>, is a search engine for finding symbols in the
running Lisp whose names contain the contiguous characters specified
in the String field. Exactly those characters, contiguous and in the
specified order must appear in the symbol name. Case only matters when
the case mode is sensitive or if a symbol has a mixed case name (which
is unusual).
</p>
<p id="5">
The search can be constrained to just symbols exported from their home
package, to just symbols naming functions (actually operators --
functions, generic functions, and macros, that is symbols for which
<a href="../../ansicl/dictentr/fboundp.htm"><b>fboundp</b></a> returns
true), to just naming variables (symbols for which <a href="../../ansicl/dictentr/boundp.htm"><b>boundp</b></a> returns true), or to just
symbols naming classes. The search can also be constrained to symbols
accessible in a single specific package, as in the illustration, where
only symbols accessible in the <code>top-level</code> package
are shown..
</p>
<h3 id="6">
The String field
</h3>
<p id="7">
Enter the string (without quotation marks) to be searched for. There
are no wildcards. Only symbols whose name contains the exact
characters entered in this field, in order and contiguous are
displayed. (Thus, in the
illustration, only symbols containing "float" are displayed. A symbol
named <code>flomat</code>, if there was one, would not
appear.)
</p>
<p id="8">
When you have entered the desired string, click Search or press Enter
to display the results. A drop-down list shows previous
strings. Changing a string does not update the results display until
Search is clicked or Enter is pressed.
</p>
<p id="9">
A warning dialog appears if no symbols fit the search criteria.
</p>
<h3 id="10">
Warnings when no characters or only one character appears in the String field
</h3>

<p id="11">
When the String field is empty, all symbols that fit the other
criteria would be included. Displaying so much in a dialog is
problematic, and thus doing so is not supported. If you click Search
when there is nothing in the String field, a dialog is displayed
saying <i>Enter a search string before doing an apropos search</i>. No
search is done when no characters are in the String field.
</p>
<p id="12">
There can also be very many symbols that contain a single specified
character. Searching on a single letter is supported but a warning
dialog is displayed before the search is done to allow you to confirm
your intention. Such a search, if performed, can take an appreciable
amount of time.
</p>

<h3 id="13">
The Show Exported Symbols Only check box
</h3>
<p id="14">
If checked, only symbols exported from their home package are
displayed. In the illustration, this box is not checked and so
 <code>cg.grid-widget::section-size-float</code>
(not exported from the cg.grid-widget package) is
shown. Unexported symbols are identified by double colons following
the package nickname and by no mark in the Exp column (exported
symbols have a mark in the Exp column).
</p>
<p id="15">
The display is updated immediately if you check or uncheck this
checkbox.
</p>
<h3 id="16">
The Packages field
</h3>
<p id="17">
Symbols in all packages are shown if the All checkbox is checked. If
it is unchecked, as in the illustration, only symbols accessible in
the package named in the drop-down list are shown. All symbols whose
home package is the package to search are displayed. Other accessible
symbols are those exported from a package used by the package to
search. Thus, symbols in the common-lisp (nickname cl) package appear
whenever the package to search uses the common-lisp package (and most
do). There is no way to restrict the search to symbols whose home
package is the package to search. There is also no way to restrict the
search to more than one package. All or one are the only choices.
</p>
<p id="18">
The display is not updated automatically if you change from All to a
single package or change the single package. Click on the Search
button to update the display.
</p>
<h3 id="19">
The Show field
</h3>
<p id="20">
If All is selected, all symbols fitting other criteria (contain
string, accessible in package) are displayed. If Functions is
selected, just those symbols naming functions (or generic functions or
macros) are displayed. If Variables is selected just those symbols
that have a value are displayed. If Class, just those naming a
class. Changing the Show field causes the display to be updated
immediately. Note that a single symbol can name a function, a variable
and a class.
</p>
<h3 id="21">
The results display
</h3>
<p id="22">
The results of a search are displayed in the List View control labeled
"Symbols containing [string]". The symbol name appears on the left,
then the nickname of the home package, then whether the symbol names a
function, whether that function is setf'able, whether the symbol names
a variable, whether it names a class, and whether it is exported
from its home package, whether it names a compiler macro, and whether
it names a symbol macro.
</p>

<p id="23">
The <b>Function</b> column will display "generic" for a generic
function, "function" for a nongeneric function, "macro" for a macro,
"special operator" for a special operator, or "functor" for a Prolog
functor. The <b>Var</b> column will display "var" for a global
variable or "con" for a constant. The <b>Class</b> column will display
"class" for a standard-class, "struct" for a structure-class, "nonstd"
for certain non-standard classes, or "type" for a type that does not
name a class (such as bignum). Other columns will display only a
single particular string indicator or nothing, such as "setf" in
the <b>Setf</b> column, where the particular string simply makes it
unnecessary to look up at the column header for the meaning of the
indicator.
</p>

<p id="24">
Double clicking on a symbol name (or selecting it and pressing enter)
displays a Find Definition dialog allowing you to find the source code
of the definition of the symbol if that code is available.
</p>
<p id="25">
At any time, clicking on the Search button updates the display.
