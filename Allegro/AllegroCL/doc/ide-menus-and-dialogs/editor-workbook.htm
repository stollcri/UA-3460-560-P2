<p id="3">
The Editor Workbook is a dialog showing one or more editor
buffers. Each buffer may be open to a file, or may contain text data
not yet saved to a file. Display the Editor Workbook with <a href="view-menu.htm#editor">View |
Editor</a>. Open a new buffer with <a href="file-menu.htm#new">File | New</a>. Open an existing text
file with <a href="file-menu.htm#open">File | Open</a>. Save with <a href="file-menu.htm#save">File |
Save</a> (you are prompted for a filename if the buffer is not
already associated with a file). Close with <a href="file-menu.htm#close-pane">File | Close
Pane</a> when the buffer to be closed is selected. Most of the
commands on the IDE menu-bar are applicable in the editor, typically
acting on the symbol or other "word" that the text cursor is on.  The
<a href="edit-menu.htm">Edit menu</a> is
especially directed at the editor.
</p>
<p id="4">
When saving a new IDE editor buffer for the first time, a yes-or-no
dialog will first ask whether you want to add the new file to the
current project.  (This dialog will not appear if there is no current
project, or for a form's editor buffer since that is already in the
project.)  If you answer yes, then the <b>Save File</b> dialog will
default to the project's default directory, and the file will be added
to the project.  If you answer no, then the <b>Save File</b> dialog will
default as it otherwise would, which is generally to the directory in
which a file was last selected in this dialog, and the file will not
be added to the current project.
</p>
<p id="5">
Here is the Editor Workbook when Allegro CL and the IDE starts up,
with one untitled buffer named Untitled. (If the Editor Workbook is
not visible, it can be displayed with the <a href="view-menu.htm#editor">View |
Editor</a> command.)
</p>
<p id="6">
<p id="7"><img src="../pictures/ewb.jpg"></p>
</p>
<p id="8">
Editing in an editor buffer is mostly standard (type what you want and
characters appear at the cursor, selecting text and typing deletes the
selection, replacing it with what is typed, etc.) The behavior of key
chords (a modifier key, like Control or Alt pressed with one or more
character keys) depends on the current Comtab, which is specified on
the <a href="options-dialog-editor.htm">Editor
tab</a> of the <a href="options-dialog.htm">Options dialog</a>. The predefined comtabs
are Host, Emacs, and Brief. Clicking <a href="help-menu.htm#shortcut-keys">Help | Shortcut Keys</a>
displays a <a href="shortcut-keys-dialog.htm">dialog</a> showing the key
combinations, the function called by the key combination, and whether
the source of each keyboard shortcut is the IDE menu-bar, a global
keyboard shortcut, or the current editor comtab. See <a href="../variables/ide/s_text-edit-comtab_s.htm"><code>*text-edit-comtab*</code></a> to find out
how to add your own key bindings to the IDE editor's comtab (command
table).
</p>
<p id="9">
<b>Useful shortcut for copying Lisp expressions</b>. (This particular
shortcut is not listed in the <a href="help-menu.htm#shortcut-keys">Help | Shortcut Keys</a>
dialog because it does not involve a keystroke.) If you hold down the
Control key and left-click in the editor, the lisp expression at the
clicked position will be copied to the current text cursor position.
This is most useful when you are typing in new code and are about to
re-type something that is visible elsewhere in the editor buffer: in
this case you can simply click on the expression to copy it to the
point where you are entering code. To copy a form, click just before
the opening parenthesis of the form (or just after the closing
parenthesis if there is no opening parenthesis at the same character
position). To copy a string, click just before the opening
double-quote character. Otherwise the word that is at or near the
clicked position will be copied; this may be a symbol, or simply a set
of characters that could be read as a symbol. If the Shift Key
is held down along with the Control key, then the text is moved rather
than copied. These keystrokes are features of the <a href="../classes/cg/lisp-edit-pane.htm"><code>lisp-edit-pane</code></a> and <a href="../classes/cg/multi-line-lisp-text.htm"><code>multi-line-lisp-text</code></a> classes, which may be used
in applications.
</p>
<p id="10">
This shortcut does not appear in the Shortcuts dialog because it
involves a mouse click and is thus not a key chord.
</p>

<h3 id="11">
Compiling and Evaluating Forms
</h3>

<p id="12">
Two commands that are used frequently in the IDE Editor are the
<a href="tools-menu.htm#incremental-compile">Tools | Incremental Compile</a> command
and the <a href="tools-menu.htm#incremental-evaluation">Tools | Incremental Evaluation</a>
command. The word "incremental" in these names means that you can
compile or evaluate individual definitions or other expressions each
time you modify your code incrementally.
</p>
<p id="13">
The keyboard shortcuts for these commands (when the editor is in Host
mode) are control-D and control-E.  So typically each time you have
just modified a defun form or other definition, you can quickly
recompile that individual definition by first making sure that the
text cursor is somewhere inside the definition, then typing control-D
to compile it, and then perhaps retesting the code.
</p>
<p id="14">
If instead you want to evaluate a top-level form, then you would type
control-E instead -- the values returned by the evaluation will be
printed to the listener in the Debug Window.  If you are evaluating
particular forms frequently, evaluating them in the editor (and saving
them to a file) may be handier than re-entering them in the Debug
Window or finding them in the Debug Window's command history.
</p>
<p id="15">
When no text is selected, these commands are applied to the top-level
form that the text cursor is currently inside or after.  (A top-level
form is simply one that begins with an open parenthesis in the
leftmost column of the editor buffer.)  Specifically, the command will
be applied to a top-level form if the text cursor is either
immediately before its opening parenthesis, or somewhere inside the
form, or after the form but before the position immediately before the
next top-level form (if any).
</p>
<p id="16">
When any text is selected, these commands are applied directly to the
selected text rather than to a top-level form. This is generally more
useful for evaluation than for compilation. Text can be selected as
usual by dragging the mouse with the left button down. In addition, a
handy way to select a lisp form is to double-click immediately before
the form's opening parenthesis. If multiple expressions are selected,
then each one is compiled or evaluated in succession. You can even
use the <a href="edit-menu.htm#select-all">Edit | Select All</a>
command (control-A) to select all text and
then compile or evaluate the entire editor buffer. 
</p>
<p id="17">
Another way to evaluate an expression in the editor is to place the
text cursor just before the expression and then press the Enter key on
the numeric keypad.  (Or hold down the Alt key and press the main
Enter key.)  In addition to evaluating the expression, this also moves
the text cursor just past the expression; this allows you to evaluate
a sequence of expressions by pressing the numeric keypad's Enter key
repeatedly. It is OK to repeat this keystroke quickly, because
each successive evaluation will not be done until the previous one has
returned. If the Control key is held down while pressing the numeric
keypad's Enter key, or both Control and Alt are held down while
pressing the main Enter key, then the form to be evaluated will first
be copied to the listener as if it had been entered there at the
prompt; this provides more context for reviewing the output in the
listener.

</p>

<h3 id="18">The Tab Key in the Editor Workbook</h3>

<p id="19">
The Tab key in all Comtab modes indents the current line appropriately
for displaying Lisp text. Thus, if you have entered
</p>
<pre id="20">
(defun foo (x)
</pre>
<p id="21">
pressing Enter moves the cursor to the next line, adding spaces so the
character typed is just under the `e' in `defun'. If you place the
cursor at the beginning of the second line and press Tab, the cursor
moves so the next character will be under the `e' in `defun' but no
Tab character is input (instead, spaces are input as required). If you
want an actual Tab character, press Shift-Tab.
</p>

<h3 id="22">The package in the Editor</h3>

<p id="23">
If there is either an <code>in-package</code> form (such as
<code>(in-package :cg-user)</code>) as the first top-level form
in a buffer, the
package in the buffer will be the specified package as soon as <b>Find
Package Specifier</b> is chosen from the Editor's Shortcut Menu
(described below on this page) or any of the menubar commands <a href="file-menu.htm#save">File |
Save</a>, <a href="tools-menu.htm#incremental-compile">Tools | Incremental Compile</a>, or
<a href="tools-menu.htm#incremental-evaluation">Tools | Incremental Evaluation</a>
are chosen.
</p>


<p id="24">
The package of the buffer affects symbol completion and whether
symbols need to be package-qualified in order for the system to
identify them (for purposes of listing arguments of functions, finding
documentation pages, etc.)
</p>

<h3 id="25">The Editor's Shortcut Menu</h3>

<p id="26">
Shortcut menus that appear when right-clicking in IDE windows. They
generally offer commands that are already available on the IDE's
menu-bar, but are considered particularly useful in the context where
the shortcut menu was invoked (Cut and Paste are on the Editor's
shortcut menu, for example, as well as on the <a href="edit-menu.htm">Edit</a> menu). However, the Editor's shortcut
menu also contains a few useful commands that are not found
elsewhere. the command are appropriate for the type of file being
edited. Not all these commands appear on the menu for all files.
</p>
<ul>
<li id="27">
<b>Add File to Project</b>: adds the source code file shown in the
currently selected editor pane to the current project. If you happen
to be editing this file already, then this command is easier than
using the Add button on the Project Manager dialog, which would
require you to re-specify the file pathname using the file selection
dialog. (This command will not appear if you are editing a new editor
buffer that has not yet been saved to a file, or when there is no
current project.)
</li>
<li id="28">
<b>Find Package Specifier</b>: detects the <code>(in-package
...)</code> form in the selected editor pane
and sets the current package of the pane to be that package, so that
the symbols in source code will be read into the correct package.
</li>
<li id="29">
<b>Select Most Recent</b>: this command exposes the editor buffer most
recently exposed before the current one. Its shortcut is
<code>Control+Shift+J</code>. This choice is on the menu in part
to remind you of the keyboard shortcut.
</li>
<li id="30">
<b>Select Next Most Recent</b>: this command exposes the editor buffer next
most
recently exposed before the current one. Its shortcut is
<code>Control+Shift+K</code>. This choice is on the menu in part
to remind you of the keyboard shortcut.
</li>
<li id="31">
<b>Select Third Most Recent</b>: this command exposes the editor
buffer third most recently exposed before the current one. Its
shortcut is <code>Control+Shift+L</code>. This choice is on the
menu in part to remind you of the keyboard shortcut.
</li>
<li id="32">
<b>Select Tab On Left</b>: this command exposes the editor buffer just
to the left of the current one. Its shortcut is
<code>Control+Shift+,</code>. This choice is on the menu in part
to remind you of the keyboard shortcut.
</li>
<li id="33">
<b>Select Tab On Right</b>: this command exposes the editor buffer just
to the right of the current one. Its shortcut is
<code>Control+Shift+.</code>. This choice is on the menu in part
to remind you of the keyboard shortcut.
</li>
</ul>

<p id="34">
The last four commands are not particularly useful for selecting from
the shortcut menu itself, since it would be easier simply to click on the
desired editor pane's tab instead. They appear on the menu as a
reminder of their handy keystroke equivalents. For example, pressing
control-shift-comma in the editor (perhaps more easily remembered as
control-left-angle-bracket) selects the editor pane to the immediate
left of the currently selected pane; and pressing control-shift-J
selects the most recently selected pane. All such keyboard shortcuts
may be found on the <a href="shortcut-keys-dialog.htm">dialog</a> displayed by choosing
<a href="help-menu.htm#shortcut-keys">Help | Shortcut Keys</a>.
</p>
<p id="35">
These commands are handy for selecting various editor panes without
needing to take a hand off the keyboard while typing. They are related
to the Show Second, Show Third, and Show Fourth commands on the
<a href="view-menu.htm#manage">View | Manage Windows</a> submenu, though
those menu-bar commands apply to top-level IDE windows while these
shortcut menu commands apply to panes within a single top-level
window. These commands are also available in the Debug Window.
</p>

<h3 id="36">
Highlighting the tab of the currently-selected buffer
</h3>

<p id="37">
When the IDE configuration option <a href="../operators/ide/highlight-selected-editor-tab.htm"><b>highlight-selected-editor-tab</b></a> is true, the IDE
editor will always highlight the tab of the currently-selected
buffer. This option is initially true, as the otherwise visual
indication of the currently selected tab is rather subtle.
