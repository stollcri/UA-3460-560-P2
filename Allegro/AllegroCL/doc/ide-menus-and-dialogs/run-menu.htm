<p id="3">
The Run Menu displays commands for testing forms and projects and for
using tools that affect or report on how a program runs. The commands
on the menu are:
</p>

<ul><li id="4"><b><a name="run-project">Run Project</a></b> -- 
Run the current project by calling the project Init Function. The
default project init function creates and displays the main form.
<p id="5">
When you run a project (as opposed to running a single form with
<a href="run-menu.htm#run-form">Run
Form</a>), the windows of the project are created in their own
window hierarchy (or hierarchies), completely separate from IDE window
hierarchy. This is done so that running the project from the IDE will
emulate the eventual standalone application as closely as possible for
more complete debugging.
</p>
<p id="6">
But this also means that IDE keyboard shortcuts are not available
while the running project windows are selected, and the entire running
project may get buried behind the IDE, since the whole IDE is always
either in front of or in back of the entire running project. You can
switch between the running project and the IDE as you would between
two applications, by using the Windows Task Bar or the Alt-Tab
gesture.
</p>
<p id="7">
The behavior is different when running a single form (with the <a href="run-menu.htm#run-form">Run
Form</a> command). In that case, the running window will be owned
by the invisible IDE owner window, and therefore it can be
intermingled among the various IDE windows and you can still use IDE
keyboard shortcuts and so on.  If you run a project when it is already
running, the current running instance is first halted (and its windows
are closed) and then the project is run again from scratch.
</p>
</li></ul>



<ul><li id="8"><b><a name="run-form">Run Form</a></b> -- 
Run the currently-selected form; that is, create and display the
window associated with the currently-selected form.
<p id="9">
When you run a form, the running window for the form is owned by the
invisible IDE owner window. Therefore, the running window behaves as
if it were part of the IDE. That is, the window may be intermingled
among the various IDE windows, and the IDE keyboard shortcuts may
still be used. This is done so that the IDE is still conveniently
available while quickly testing single forms.
</p>
<p id="10">
This behavior is different from the behavior when running the whole
project by choosing the <a href="run-menu.htm#run-project">Run Project</a> menu command or clicking the
Run button on the Toolbar. When a project is run, the project's
windows are created in their own hierarchy completely separate from
the IDE, so that the running project will emulate the eventual
standalone application as nearly as possible for more complete
debugging.
</p>
<p id="11">
If you run a form which is already running, the current running
window is first closed, and then it is created and run again from
scratch.
</p>
</li></ul>

<ul><li id="12"><b><a name="stop">Stop</a></b> -- 
Stops the running form or project and removes the active windows built
from forms.
</li></ul>



<ul><li id="13"><b><a name="interrupt">Interrupt</a></b> -- 
Tries to interrupt current computation. It may be what needs to be
interrupted prevents the <a href="run-menu.htm">Run</a> menu from displaying. The keyboard
equivalent is the Pause key and pressing it may perform the interrupt.
</li></ul>


<ul><li id="14"><b><a name="run-project-w-rt">Run Project with Runtime Analysis</a></b> -- 
Like <a href="run-menu.htm#run-project">Run Project</a>, with additional behavior to
perform a runtime analysis of the run.  This command wraps a call
to <a href="../operators/prof/with-profiling.htm"><b>with-profiling</b></a> around the
running of the project, and will analyze only the process of the
running project. When the project run exits (typically by closing the
project's main window), it will also automatically display the new
analysis in the <a href="runtime-analyzer-results-dialog.htm">Runtime Analyzer
Results</a> dialog. The Runtime Analyzer is described
in <a href="../runtime-analyzer.htm">runtime-analyzer.htm</a>.
</li></ul>




<ul><li id="15"><b><a name="trace">Trace</a></b> -- 
Starts tracing the currently selected symbol.
</li></ul>



<ul><li id="16"><b><a name="untrace">Untrace</a></b> -- 
Stops tracing of the selected symbol.
</li></ul>



<ul><li id="17"><b><a name="untrace-all">Untrace All</a></b> -- 
Stops all tracing.
</li></ul>



<ul><li id="18"><b><a name="retrace">Retrace</a></b> -- 
This command on the <a href="run-menu.htm">Run</a> menu causes functions that were being
traced when <a href="run-menu.htm#untrace-all">Run | Untrace All</a> was chosen to again be
traced. Also, if choosing <a href="run-menu.htm#untrace">Run | Untrace</a> resulted in
nothing being traced, Retrace causes the last object traced to be
traced again.
</li></ul>



<ul><li id="19"><b><a name="trace-status">Trace Status</a></b> -- 
Prints information about what is being traced to the status bar.
</li></ul>



<ul><li id="20"><b><a name="trace-dialog">Trace Dialog</a></b> -- 
Displays the <a href="trace-dialog.htm">Trace
Dialog</a>.
</li></ul>





<ul><li id="21"><b><a name="set-breakpoint">Set Breakpoint</a></b> -- : add a breakpoint at the top of the selected
function or method, if any, as with the
top-level <a href="../tpl-commands/break.htm"><b>:break</b></a> command. This is
typically used to set up stepping with the <a href="stepper-dialog.htm">Stepper Dialog</a>.
<p id="22">
If the selected object is the name of a generic function, then a
pop-up menu will appear asking which method to breakpoint; the special
<b>All</b> choice will breakpoint all methods of the generic
function.
</p>
<p id="23">
If the <a href="stepper-dialog.htm">Stepper
Dialog</a> is currently selected, and the <b>Definition Pane</b>
has the keyboard focus and is highlighting a selected form, then the
breakpoint will be set on the selected form inside the function being
stepped through. The selected form is the one under the mouse if any,
and otherwise the form at which the stepper is stopped.
</p>

<p id="24">(In releases prior to 8.2, the breakpoint commands on the Run menu
worked with the trace facility's breakpoint option, rather than
emulating the top-level <a href="../tpl-commands/break.htm"><b>:break</b></a>
command.  To emulate the old behavior, you would need to use
the <a href="../../ansicl/dictentr/traceunt.htm"><b>trace</b></a> macro itself.)
</p>

</li></ul>
<ul><li id="25"><b><a name="remove-breakpoint">Remove Breakpoint</a></b> -- : remove the breakpoint at the top of the
selected function or method, if any. (Or the breakpoint on the
selected form in the <a href="stepper-dialog.htm">Stepper
Dialog</a> as with <b>Set Breakpoint</b>
above.)
</li></ul>
<ul><li id="26"><b><a name="remove-all-breakpoints">Remove All Breakpoints</a></b> -- 
Remove all currently-defined breakpoints.
</li></ul>
<ul><li id="27"><b><a name="break-status">Break Status</a></b> -- : print a list of the currently breakpointed
functions to the listener.
</li></ul>
<ul><li id="28"><b><a name="stepper-dialog">Stepper Dialog</a></b> -- : display the <a href="stepper-dialog.htm">Stepper Dialog</a> for stepping
incrementally through the source code of compiled application
functions and methods, stopping at breakpoints.
</li></ul>



<ul><li id="29"><b><a name="runtime-analyzer-control">Runtime Analyzer Control</a></b> -- 
Displays a submenu with the following choices:
<ul>
<li id="30">
<b>Start/Resume Sampling</b>: if no runtime analysis has been started, start
data collection. If an analysis is being run but data collection is suspended
(with <b>Suspend Sampling</b>), resume data collection.
</li>
<li id="31">
<b>Suspend Sampling</b>: suspends data collection until <b>Start/Resume
Sampling</b> is clicked.
</li>
<li id="32">
<b>Stop</b>: stops data collection. After clicking this
command, runtime analysis data is ready for analysis. Starting
sampling again will destroy current data.
</li>
<li id="33">
<b>Runtime Analyzer Status</b>: prints information about the runtime
analyzer (whether sampling is going on, etc.) to the status bar of
the Project Window.
</li>
</ul>
</li></ul>

<ul><li id="34"><b><a name="runtime-analyzer-control-dialog">Runtime Analyzer Control Dialog</a></b> --  Displays the
<a href="runtime-analyzer-control-dialog.htm">Runtime Analyzer Control
dialog</a>, which provides tools for controlling the runtime
analyzer.
</li></ul>

<ul><li id="35"><b><a name="runtime-analyzer-results-dialog">Runtime Analyzer Results Dialog</a></b> --  Displays the
<a href="runtime-analyzer-results-dialog.htm">Runtime Analyzer Results
dialog</a>, which displays information about runtime analysis
data.
</li></ul>


<ul><li id="36"><b><a name="prioritize-ide-response">Prioritize IDE Response</a></b> --  When checked, the IDE is more
responsive to user gestures while user code is being evaluated, but
responsivess of other applications may be reduced in certain cases,
such as glitches in music playback during a dragging operation in the
IDE on Windows.  See <a href="../operators/ide/ide-priority.htm"><b>ide:ide-priority</b></a> for more information.
