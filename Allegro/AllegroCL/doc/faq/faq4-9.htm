<p><a name="4.9-1"></a><strong>Q 4.9-1)</strong> Why does <strong>composer:start-composer</strong>
sometimes warn that &quot;fcntl failed&quot;? </p>

<p><strong>A 4.9-1)</strong> On some versions of Solaris, after loading in foreign code
contained in a shared library (a .so file), the call to <strong>composer:start-composer</strong>
can produce a warning: </p>

<p>USER(1): (composer:start-composer) <br>
Warning: fcntl failed <br>
[1] USER(2): </p>

<p>That is, if you do <font face="Courier New">(require :composer)</font>, load some
shared libraries, and then call <strong>composer:start-composer</strong>, you may get the
error above. If you load a shared library into an image that has composer built into it,
you will get the same warning. </p>

<p>If you do see this warning, you can safely ignore it, in our experience. Composer
appears to work even though the warning is printed. If you are really bothered by the
warning, you can <font face="Courier New">(require :composer)</font> after loading your
shared libraries. This should make the warning go away.</p>
