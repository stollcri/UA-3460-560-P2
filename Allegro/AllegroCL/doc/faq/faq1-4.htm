<p><a name="141"></a><strong>Q 1.4-1)</strong> What is the relationship between this FAQ
and ACL documentation?</p>

<p><strong>A 1.4-1)</strong> The ACL documentation, comprising a collection of HTML files
in the <em>doc/</em> subdirectory of the Allegro directory (where Allegro CL was
installed), the Installation Guide (<a href="../installation.htm">&lt;Allegro
directory&gt;/doc/installation.htm</a>, a (printed) READ THIS FIRST document shipped with
the ACL CD-ROM, and this FAQ are designed to be mutually exclusive. It is our intention to
maintain this FAQ as a repository of current frequently-asked questions which have arisen
since the last release of the ACL documentation (and are sometimes pertinent only to a
certain release of ACL). Those questions which endure across releases will be incorporated
into the ACL documentation in due course, and then removed from the FAQ.</p>

<p><a name="142"></a><strong>Q 1.4-2)</strong> Is the ACL documentation available on-line?</p>

<p><strong>A 1.4-2)</strong> Yes, all the Allegro CL documentation is online.</p>

<p>The on-line documentation is available on your machine after you install Allegro CL and
on our web site at <a
href="http://www.franz.com/support/documentation/8.0/doc/introduction.htm">http://www.franz.com/support/documentation/8.0/doc/introduction.htm</a>
(that document has pointers to the other documentation files).</p>

<p>The document <a href="../introduction.htm"><em>&lt;Allegro
directory&gt;/doc/introduction.htm</em></a> describes the Allegro CL documentation set. We
recommend that you make that document a bookmark in your browser.</p>

<hr>

<p><a name="143"></a><strong>Q 1-4.3)</strong> Is the ACL documentation updated between
releases, and if so, where can I get the update?</p>

<p><strong>A 1-4.3)</strong> Online documentation is updated, but the distribution CD's
are not changed. The updated documentation is available on the Franz Inc. Web Site (<a
href="http://www.franz.com/">http://www.franz.com/</a>) and versions are available for
downloading. See the page <a href="http://www.franz.com/support/documentation/">http://www.franz.com/support/documentation/</a>.
It will say whether there have been any updates and tell you how to obtain them if there
have been.</p>
