<p><a name="481"></a><strong>Q 4.8-1)</strong> How do I set up an Excel spreadsheet for
use with AODBC?</p>

<p><strong>A 4.8-1)</strong> It turns out there's a bit of trickiness involved in making
an Excel spreadsheet truly usable via the ODBC interface. The spreadsheet must conform to
two specifications. First, the first row must be a &quot;title row&quot; containing the
names of all the columns in the spreadsheet. Second, the table, that is the portion of the
spreadsheet you are interested in, must be named, so that queries can be made on it. How
to name a table is described in step 2 below. </p>

<p>To properly set up your Excel spreadsheet for use via the ODBC interface, follow the
steps below. 

<ol>
  <li>Start with a spreadsheet. The first row of items should be the list of field names above
    each column of actual data. This is where the ODBC driver grabs its column names. </li>
  <li>To name the table in the spreadsheet that you are interested in, you must create a
    &quot;Named Range.&quot; From Excel, you must first highlight the range of cells you want
    to create the table from; <strong>this should include the column names as well</strong>.
    From the menubar, choose INSERT-&gt;NAME-&gt;DEFINE. This should open a dialog where you
    can enter a name for your table. After typing this in, click 'ADD' and then save your
    spreadsheet. </li>
</ol>
