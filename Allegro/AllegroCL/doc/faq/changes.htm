<p><a href="index.htm">Go to main FAQ page.</a> (Note the filename of the main page is now
<a href="index.htm">index.htm</a>.)</p>

<p>Each item in the FAQ has a date indicating the last significant modification. (A
modification is significant if new or different information is provided. A modification
that simply fixes trivial and obvious errors, such as spelling errors, or simply updates
the version number is not considered significant.) Items that are new or substantially
changed for Allegro CL 8.0 have a date 12/1/05 or later. Items with earlier dates are not
changed significantly for release 8.0. </p>
