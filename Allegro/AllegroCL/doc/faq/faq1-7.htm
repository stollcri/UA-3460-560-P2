<p><a name="171"></a><strong>Q 1.7-1)</strong> How do I know if Allegro CL will run on my
operating system version? </p>

<p><strong>A 1.7-1)</strong> Our policy of support of Allegro CL on specific operating
system versions is as follows: 

<ul>
  <li>For each verion release of Allegro CL, we compose a list of current operating system
    levels on which we have tested and on which we know will work. This list is located in <a
    href="../installation.htm">installation.htm</a> in the section <a
    href="../installation.htm#install-sizes-2">Installation sizes and supported Operating
    System</a> versions.</li>
  <li>Because Allegro CL runs on so many different operating systems, and because some of
    these operating systems have almost infinite combinatorial possibilities, including
    patches and/or user-modification, we do not attempt to certify Allegro CL on specific
    operating system versions. Instead, we rely on the tendency of the operating system
    vendors to maintain upward compatibility, and we usually build on the lowest operating
    system version for which we have listed support. As long as the operating system is truly
    upward compatible, Allegro CL should work on the newer versions, and our advice is to try
    it out. But we also recommend strongly that you run such tests on a machine that is not
    part of your production process, in case things don't go well.</li>
</ul>

<p>Information we have about Allegro CL on operating system versions released after the
release of Allegro CL 8.0 is available at <a

<p><a name="172"></a><strong>Q 1.7-2)</strong> What is the best question to ask of Franz
Inc as to my particular operating system and Allegro CL? </p>

<p><strong>A 1.7-2)</strong> If the operating system you are interested in running Allegro
CL on is the same lineage and the underlying architecture is the same as one which we have
already listed as supporting, the best question to ask us is <strong>Have you had any
compatibility issues with running Allegro CL on Operating system XYZ?</strong> We can
answer this question &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;, which will tell you as the
customer whether we have any negative experiences with the operating system version. (The
information at <a href="http://www.franz.com/support/osinfo.lhtml">http://www.franz.com/support/osinfo.lhtml</a>
may provide the answer.) If the operating system is very new, the answer to this question
might more likely be &quot;no&quot;, because the assumption is that the new version is
compatible, unless and until it proves otherwise. Another question that you might ask, if
you know that your operating system is very new, is <strong>Do you know of customers who
are successfully running Allegro CL on Operating system XYZ?</strong></p>

<p>The fundamental issue with Allegro CL working on a new operating system versions is
whether the operating system has any fundamental issues that break Allegro CL. Typically,
when the operating system is a natural progression from one which we currently support, we
will take specific steps to resolve incompatibilities. Incompatibilities most often occur
when an operating system vendor changes the signal-handling interface, usually to be more
Posix compliant. The change can break Allegro CL. This has happened in the last several
years to Linux, LinuxPPC, FreeBSD, and MacOSX, in that time order.</p>
