<p><a name="121"></a><strong>Q 1.2-1)</strong> How should I report bugs?</p>

<p><strong>A 1.2-1)</strong> Use <strong>dribble-bug</strong>, documented in the section
on <a href="../introduction.htm#reporting-bugs-1">Reporting Bugs</a> in <a
href="../introduction.htm"><em>&lt;Allegro directory&gt;/doc/introduction.htm</em></a> and
in <a href="../operators/excl/dribble-bug.htm"><em>&lt;Allegro
directory&gt;/doc/operators/excl/dribble-bug.htm</em></a>.</p>

<hr>

<p><a name="122"></a><strong>Q 1.2-2)</strong> dribble-bug output seems to lag behind Lisp
I/O.</p>

<p><strong>A 1.2-2)</strong> <a href="../operators/excl/dribble-bug.htm">dribble-bug</a><strong>
</strong>always catches up with the Lisp I/O (which is stored in a buffer before it goes
into the dribble file). </p>

<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (force-output excl::*dribble-stream*)</pre>

<p>Will cause all buffered output to be written to the file.</p>

<hr>

<p><a name="123"></a><strong>Q 1.2-3)</strong> Sometimes CL output is not logged in the
dribble-bug file. What do I do about this?</p>

<p><strong>A 1.2-3)</strong> <a href="../operators/excl/dribble-bug.htm">dribble-bug</a>
should only miss output produced when using the foreign-function interface or running a
shell function with <a href="../operators/excl/run-shell-command.htm">run-shell-command</a>
and friends, or (because it is produced by C code) information printed by the garbage
collector during a garbage collection. Some messages from foreign code may be written
directly to Unix stdout or stderr, bypassing Lisp entirely. To circumvent this problem,
you can either use an Emacs buffer or the Unix utility &quot;script&quot; to save the
entire transaction record.</p>

<hr>

<p><a name="124"></a><strong>Q 1.2-4)</strong> Is there a mailing list for Allegro CL? How
do I sign up?</p>

<p><strong>A 1.2-4)</strong> Yes, there is a mailing list for Allegro CL users. It is
accessed through the address <a href="mailto:allegro-cl@franz.com">allegro-cl@franz.com</a>.
To be added to or deleted from this list, send mail to <a
href="mailto:allegro-cl-request@franz.com">allegro-cl-request@franz.com</a>. Franz
periodically makes announcements on this mailing list, but its main purpose is to allow
users of Allegro CL (both Unix and Windows) to communicate with each other, sharing ideas,
complaints and code.</p>

<p>Note that the mailing list address used to be <b>allegro-cl@cs.berkeley.edu</b> (and
requests went to <b>allegro-cl-request@cs.berkeley.edu</b>). The host has been changed to <strong>franz.com</strong>
for technical reasons. Please note that except for spam filtering (which was in place even
when the host was <strong>cs.berkeley.edu</strong>), the list is uncensored and membership
is open to all. Further note that the accuracy of postings made to the list is not
guaranteed.</p>
