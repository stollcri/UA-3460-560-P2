<p><a name="381"></a><strong>Q 3.8-1)</strong> I get an error when I try to build an image
with <strong>excl:build-lisp-image</strong> (and also with <strong>excl:generate-application</strong>)
but the build process simply quits. How can I debug this error?</p>

<p><strong>A 3-8.1)</strong> Since <a href="../operators/excl/generate-application.htm">generate-application</a>
calls <a href="../operators/excl/build-lisp-image.htm">build-lisp-image</a>, the same
answer applies to both functions.</p>

<p>See section <a href="../building-images.htm#build-debug-1">Debugging an image build
problem or failure</a> in <a href="../building-images.htm">building-images.htm</a>.</p>

<p><a name="384"></a><strong>Q 3.8-4)</strong> I notice that when I run <a
href="../operators/excl/generate-application.htm">generate-application</a>, a license file
is placed in the distribution directory. Is that license file tied to the image file?</p>

<p><strong>A 3.8-4)</strong> There is a license file created when <a
href="../operators/excl/generate-application.htm">generate-application</a> is called. It
is named <em>&lt;application-name&gt;.lic</em> and is placed in the distribution
directory. It must be there to run the application and it is tied to the application image
(<em>dxl</em>) file: it only works with that image file and that image file only works
when the license file is present. If you have to update the image file (for example, to
add new features to the application or to fix bugs), be sure to create the new image using
<a href="../operators/excl/generate-application.htm">generate-application</a> (which will,
of course, create a whole directory of files including the image and a new license file)
and be sure to send at least both the image and the license file to the application users.
(The more typical thing to do is to send the whole directory.)</p>
