Common Graphics is a code library that allows writing windowized
graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in applications.  The IDE is a set of
integrated tools that facilitate the writing and debugging of
applications, including CG applications. Both of these tools are available only on Windows, on
x86-based Linux platforms with GTK, and on the Mac.

<hr><hr><h2 id="87"><a name="simple-streams-1">4.0 Common Graphics Streams</a></h2>

<p id="88">
In addition to being a window for displaying graphical output and
accepting user gestures, a Common Graphics window is also a Common
Lisp stream.  This means that text can be printed to a window by
calling CL stream output functions like <b>print</b> and
<b>format</b>, as an alternative to calling a CG function like <a href="operators/cg/d/draw-string-in-box.htm"><b>draw-string-in-box</b></a>.  (And CL stream
input functions work with a few classes such as <a href="classes/cg/text-edit-pane.htm"><code>text-edit-pane</code></a>.)
</p>
<p id="89">
Common Graphics streams are interactive streams (see
<a href="../ansicl/dictentr/interact.htm"><b>interactive-stream-p</b></a>), and so
you typically will not need to call <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/finish-o.htm"><b>finish-output</b></a> or <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/finish-o.htm"><b>force-output</b></a> to make printed output appear
immediately in a Common Graphics window.  But if you call lower-level
Common Lisp stream output functions (basically <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/write-st.htm"><b>write-string</b></a>, <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/write-ch.htm"><b>write-char</b></a>, and <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/write-se.htm"><b>write-sequence</b></a>) then no
<a href="../ansicl/dictentr/finish-o.htm"><b>force-output</b></a> is
done internally even for interactive streams.  After calling such
functions on a Common Graphics stream, you should call <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/finish-o.htm"><b>force-output</b></a> or
<a href="../ansicl/dictentr/finish-o.htm"><b>finish-output</b></a> on the stream
before subsequently calling any graphics-related Common Graphics
functions, or else the sequencing of graphical output may be
incorrect. For more information,
see <a href="streams.htm#force-finish-output-2">Force-output and finish-output policy</a>
in <a href="streams.htm">streams.htm</a>.

<p id="91">
The pre-built lisp images <i>allegro.dxl</i> and
<i>allegro-ansi.dxl</i> contain CG and the IDE. (The
image supplied with Allegro CL Express is
<i>allegro-express.</i>] and is equivalent to
<i>allegro-ansi.dxl</i>.) The IDE (with CG) may be started directly
by running the associated executable files, whose names on Windows are

<i>allegro.exe</i> and <i>allegro-ansi.exe</i>
(allegro-express.exe for Allegro CL Express), and on Linux and the Mac are
<i>allegro</i> and <i>allegro-ansi</i>.  The "allegro-ansi" images are
case-insensitive, as in the ANSI Common Lisp specification, while the
"allegro" images are case-sensitive to be more compatible with other
modern software. Both use 16-bit characters. There are no pre-built
8-bit character images that contain the IDE. (See
<a href="#allegro-8bit-2">Section 5.1 How to create an 8-bit image which starts the IDE</a> for information on
starting the IDE in an 8-bit image and information on building an
8-bit image that includes Common Graphics and the IDE and starts the
IDE when invoked.)
</p>
<p id="92">
On Windws, there are menu items on the Allegro CL submenu of the
Windows Start menu for Modern Images and ANSI Images. Each has an
`Allegro CL (w IDE)' item. Choosing one of those starts Allegro CL and
automatically starts the IDE. See <a href="startup.htm#starting-windows-2">Starting on Windows machines</a> in
<a href="startup.htm">startup.htm</a> for more information on starting
Allegro CL on Windows. Starting on Linux and the Mac is
similar to starting on any UNIX machine;
see <a href="startup.htm#starting-unix-2">Starting on UNIX
machines</a> in
<a href="startup.htm">startup.htm</a>. 
</p>

<p id="93">
The IDE is started by calling <a href="operators/ide/start-ide.htm"><b>start-ide</b></a> with no arguments. This function is
called automatically when running one of the IDE images, or can be
called explicitly in a base lisp after requiring the
<code>:ide</code> module by evaluating <code>(require
:ide)</code>. (You cannot load the IDE into an image on Linux
Express Edition. You must use either the <b>allegro</b> or the
<b>allegro-ansi</b> executable/image.)
</p>
<p id="94">
When <a href="operators/ide/start-ide.htm"><b>start-ide</b></a> is called, it performs
the following steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li id="95">
If the command line that started the lisp contains the
<code>-batch</code> flag (see <a href="startup.htm#command-line-args-1">Command line arguments</a> in
<a href="startup.htm">startup.htm</a>), then <a href="operators/ide/start-ide.htm"><b>start-ide</b></a> exits immediately,
returning nil, and nothing else is done.
</li>
<li id="96">
Multiprocessing is started (if necessary), and the "IDE GUI" process
is created. <a href="operators/ide/start-ide.htm"><b>start-ide</b></a> returns the new IDE GUI
process. The rest of the startup procedure is performed in the IDE GUI
process.
</li>
<li id="97">
The <a href="variables/cg/s_system_s.htm"><code>*system*</code></a>
object is created (or recreated if this is a dumplisp'ed image).
</li>
<li id="98">
Common Graphics is initialized, and the main IDE owner window (see
<a href="operators/cg/d/development-main-window.htm"><b>development-main-window</b></a>) and the
IDE menu-bar window are created.
</li>
<li id="99">
If a user prefs file exists, or if no user prefs file exists, if the
file <i>prefs.cl</i> exists in the main Allegro
directory, it is loaded to restore configuration options that were
saved most recently in an earlier IDE session. (See the description of
<a href="operators/ide/save-options-to-user-specific-file.htm"><b>save-options-to-user-specific-file</b></a>
for information on user prefs files.) If no prefs file exists, default
settings are used.
</li>
<li id="100">
The IDE toolbars and status-bar are added according to the <a href="operators/ide/display-toolbars.htm"><b>display-toolbars</b></a> and
<a href="operators/ide/display-status-bar.htm"><b>display-status-bar</b></a> configuration
options.
</li>
<li id="101">

If an initial project was specified either by using the "-project"
command line argument or by double-clicking a .lpr project definition
file to start the IDE, then <a href="operators/ide/open-project.htm"><b>open-project</b></a> is called to open that existing
project. If no initial project was specified, then the IDE starts without a
current project. If there were recent projects previously open, a
dialog appears asking if you want to open any of them. Canceling
causes the IDE to open without a project.

</li>
<li id="102">
Additional IDE windows are created if the following
configuration options are true:
<ul>
<li id="103">
<a href="operators/ide/new-project-show-form.htm"><b>new-project-show-form</b></a> exposes the
initial form window of the project and creates an inspector window
inspecting that form.
</li>
<li id="104">
<a href="operators/ide/new-project-show-project-manager.htm"><b>new-project-show-project-manager</b></a>
shows the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/project-manager-dialog.htm">Project Manager</a> dialog.
</li>
<li id="105">
<a href="operators/ide/new-project-show-editor.htm"><b>new-project-show-editor</b></a> creates and
displays an <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/editor-workbook.htm">Editor
Workbook</a>.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="106">
The "Listener 1" process is created to evaluate expressions in the
initial lisp listener pane of the Debug Window, and to evaluate user
code when commands such as 
<a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/tools-menu.htm">Tools</a> |
<a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/tools-menu.htm#incremental-evaluation">Incremental Evaluation</a> and
<a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/file-menu.htm">File</a> | <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/file-menu.htm#load">Load</a>
are invoked when this listener is the selected one. <a href="variables/cg/s_default-cg-bindings_s.htm"><code>*default-cg-bindings*</code></a> is passed as
the :initial-bindings argument to <a href="operators/mp/process-run-function.htm"><b>process-run-function</b></a> when creating
this process (this should always be done when creating a process that
may create Common Graphics windows or to allow debugging that process
in the IDE). The user may create additional similar listeners later by
using the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/view-menu.htm#new-listener">View | New Listener</a> command.
</li>
<li id="107">
The IDE GUI process enters an event-handling loop to handle events
for IDE windows, which are created in this process. An abort restart
around the loop ensures that the IDE GUI process re-enters this
event-handling loop when it is reset or otherwise aborted.
</li>
<li id="108">
The Listener 1 process tells the IDE GUI process to create its listener
pane. This follows the convention where all IDE windows are created in
the IDE GUI process so that their events are all received and handled
in that process. The value of <code>(ide-evaluator-listener
*system*)</code> (see <a href="operators/ide/ide-evaluator-listener.htm"><b>ide-evaluator-listener</b></a>) is set to
this initial listener pane.
</li>
<li id="109">
If the file <i>startup.cl</i> exists in the main allegro
directory, then the Listener 1 process loads this file.  Users may
create this file to evaluate arbitrary forms whenever the IDE is
started. (If the file <i>startup.fasl</i> exists and is
not older than <i>startup.cl</i>, then
<i>startup.fasl</i> is loaded instead.)
<p id="110">
If an error is signaled while loading this file (or the
<i>prefs.cl</i> file above), a modal dialog informs you
of this and then the IDE continues to start up without loading the
rest of the file.  Debugging is not possible at this point because the
process is not yet in an event-loop to which it can return when
aborting from the debugger. You can, however, load the file
explicitly after the IDE is running in order to debug it.
</p>
</li>

<h3 id="114">Note on the initial package</h3>
<p id="115">
By default, the initial package when the IDE starts up is the
<code>common-graphics-user</code> package, nicknamed
<code>cg-user</code>. The IDE starts with this as the initial
package rather than the more traditional
<code>common-lisp-user</code> package (nicknamed
<code>cl-user</code>) so that IDE users do not need to add
package qualifiers to external Common Graphics symbols, since the
<code>cg-user</code> package uses the cg package in addition to
the packages used by the <code>cl-user</code> package. On
startup the Debug window prints <b>[changing package from
"common-lisp-user" to "common-graphics-user"]</b>, which notes the
change of package. This message is normal and no user action is
necessary. The cg-user package does not use the ide package
starting in release 8.1. ide package symbols must be
package-qualified.

<p id="116">
One of the entries in the list of <a href="variables/cg/s_default-cg-bindings_s.htm"><code>*default-cg-bindings*</code></a> (which
establishes bindings for listeners started by the IDE) binds <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/package.htm"><code>*package*</code></a> to the value returned by
<a href="operators/ide/initial-package.htm"><b>initial-package</b></a>. As we said, that
value is initially the <code>common-graphics-user</code>
package.  If you would rather have IDE listeners start up in a
different package, you can set the <a href="operators/ide/initial-package.htm"><b>initial-package</b></a> configuration
option. You do this with the following steps (we assume you want the
initial package to be the package named <code>:mypackage</code>
-- replace <code>:mypackage</code> with a keyword naming the
package you actually want):
</p>
<ol>
<li id="117">
Start Allegro CL and the IDE. (The initial package will be the
<code>common-graphics-user</code> package).
</li>
<li id="118">
Evaluate the following form:
<pre id="119">
(setf (initial-package (configuration *system*)) :mypackage)
</pre>
<p id="120">
(Alternately, edit the value of the Initial Package widget on the

<hr><h2 id="126"><a name="allegro-8bit-2">5.1 How to create an 8-bit image which starts the IDE</a></h2>


<p id="127">
As delivered, Allegro CL only provides 16-bit character size images
that contain the IDE and start the IDE when invoked. These images are
<i>allegro.dxl</i> (and its associated executable
<i>allegro.exe</i>), which is modern (case-sensitive),
and <i>allegro-ansi.dxl</i> (and its associated
executable <i>allegro-ansi.exe</i>), which is ANSI
(case-insensitive). See <a href="startup.htm#executable-names-1">Allegro CL Executables</a> in
<a href="startup.htm">startup.htm</a> for a general discussion of execuatble
and image names.
</p>
<p id="128">
If you want to run an 8-bit character size image with the IDE, you
can start an 8-bit image
(<i>alisp8.exe/alisp8.dxl</i> or
<i>mlisp8.exe/mlisp8.dxl</i>, that is <b>Start |
Programs | Allegro CL 8.0 | ANSI Images | Allegro CL (non Int'l,
ANSI)</b> or <b>Start | Programs | Allegro CL 8.0 | Modern Images |
Allegro CL (non Int'l, Modern)</b>), and then load the IDE and call
<a href="operators/ide/start-ide.htm"><b>start-ide</b></a>, by
evaluating these forms:
</p>
<pre id="129">
(require :ide)
(start-ide)
</pre>

<p id="130">
You can also build an 8-bit image that has Common Graphics and the IDE
already loaded into it, and that starts up the IDE automatically.
Evaluating the following expression, for example, would build an 8-bit
Modern IDE:
</p>

<pre id="131">
(progn
  (build-lisp-image
   "sys:allegro8.dxl"
   :build-executable (namestring (translate-logical-pathname
                                  "sys:mlisp8.exe"))
   :include-ide t
   :restart-init-function 'ide:start-ide
   :case-mode :case-sensitive-lower)
  (sys:copy-file "sys:mlisp8.exe" "sys:allegro8.exe"
                 :overwrite t))
</pre>
<p id="132">
That example builds a Modern (case-sensitive) IDE.  To build an ANSI
(case-insenstive) IDE instead, then you would need to specify the
<i>:case-mode</i> argument as
<b>:case-insensitive-upper</b>.  And to match the names of the 16-bit
IDE images, you might want to use the name "allegro8-ansi" in place of
"allegro8".  On Linux/Unix you should exclude the ".exe" suffixes in
either case.
</p>
<p id="133">
After the build completes, the files <b>allegro8.exe</b> and
<b>allegro8.dxl</b> will be in the Allegro directory. You can use the
new 8-bit IDE by running <b>allegro8.exe</b>.  (As usual, you could
run this file by double-clicking on <b>allegro8.exe</b> in the file
explorer, or by entering "allegro8" in the proper directory in a
command window, or by setting up a shortcut that invokes
<b>allegro8.exe</b>).

<hr><hr><h2 id="134"><a name="bug-reports-1">6.0 About submitting a bug report from a break in the IDE</a></h2>

<p id="135">
This page describes how to generate an automatic textual bug report
when an error occurs in the IDE environment. If the error appears to
be due to an Allegro bug, emailing this report to Franz will often
help us to debug the error.
</p>
<p id="136">
When an error occurs and the Restarts dialog (shown on the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/debug-window-after-error.htm">Debug Windows after
an error</a> page) appears with options for proceeding from the
error, click the Debug button. This will show the current function
stack as a graphical outline control. 
</p>
<p id="137">
If the keyboard focus is not already in the stack outline control,
move the focus there by clicking anywhere in the stack outline or
perhaps by using the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/view-menu.htm">View</a> | <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/view-menu.htm#manage">Manage</a> menu commands for
selecting windows that are near the top. 
</p>
<p id="138">
Then write the bug information to a file. This can be done in several ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li id="139">
<b>Click on the Write a Bug Report button above the Debug Pane</b>.
</li>
<li id="140">
<b>Invoke the
<a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/file-menu.htm">File</a> | <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/file-menu.htm#save">Save</a>
command</b>.
</li>
<li id="141">

<b>Invoke the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/file-menu.htm">File</a> |
<a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/file-menu.htm#save-as">Save
As</a> command</b>.

</li>
<li id="142">

Use the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/help-menu.htm#bug-report">Help | Write a Bug Report</a> menu command
(which also lets you choose a process).

</li>
</ul>
<p id="143">
Whichever you choose, a modal dialog appears asking for a pathname
(even if you have chosen <b>Save</b> or <b>Save As</b> before). Select
a pathname to write the bug report to. The entire function stack will
be saved textually to that file, with brief platform information at
the top of the file, and complete dribble-bug (as generated by <a href="operators/excl/dribble-bug.htm"><b>dribble-bug</b></a>) and
<i>prefs.cl</i> information at the bottom. The stack
information will include all of the arguments and local variables for
each stack frame, regardless of whether you have opened the outline
items to show the arguments and variables in the IDE. The bug report
that was written will then be shown in the IDE editor for your review.
</p>
<p id="144">
The stack information will include the normally "hidden" frames only
if the "Include Hidden Frames" button on the stack outline's toolbar
is currently pressed. Though the additional information is not always
necessary, it is best to click on this button before generating the
bug report.

<hr><hr><h2 id="145"><a name="child-parent-overlapped-etc-1">7.0 About child, parent, and owner windows</a></h2>

<h3 id="146">
Some definitions
</h3>

<ul>
<li id="147">
<b>Owner</b>: 
every window has an owner, which is either another window or
the screen. If the owner is another window, then the window will
always remain in front of the owner window and will shrink, expand,
minimize, maximize, and close whenever the owner window does.
</li>
<li id="148">
<b>Parent</b>: every window has a parent, which is either another
window or the screen. If the parent is a window, then the window will
be visible only within the interior of the parent window (in other
words, it is "clipped" at the interior border of the parent window),
it will move along with the parent window whenever the parent moves,
and it will scroll within the interior of the parent window whenever
the parent scrolls. When the parent of a window is another window, the
parent is also the owner. An existing window may be given a new parent
by calling <a href="operators/cg/p/parent.htm"><b>(setf parent)</b></a>.
</li>
<li id="149">
<b>Child window</b>:
a child window is a window whose parent is a window (not the screen).
</li>
<li id="150">
<b>Top-level window</b>: a top-level window is a window whose parent
is the screen (and not another window).
</li>
<li id="151">
<b>Owned window</b>:
an owned window is a window whose owner is a window.
</li>
<li id="152">
<b>Non-owned or free window</b>: a non-owned window, also called a
free window, is a window whose owner is the screen.
</li>
<li id="153">
<b>Child windows</b>: the child windows of a window are
the windows whose parent is that window. 
</li>
<li id="154">
<b>Child windows of the screen</b>: the child windows of the screen
are the windows whose parent is the screen. Note the slight ambiguity
here: child windows of the screen are not themselves <i>child
windows</i> but <i>top-level windows</i>.
</li>
<li id="155">
<b>Owned windows</b>: 
the owned windows of a window or the screen are the windows whose
owner is that window or screen.
</li>
</ul>

<p id="156">
Since a window can be either a child window or a top-level window, and
can also be either an owned window or not, there are four possible
combinations of these attributes. But since a child window is always
also an owned window (where the parent is also the owner), that leaves
three actual types of windows, in terms of their relationships to a
parent or owner:
</p>
<ol>
<li id="157">
Child windows, where the parent is a window. Such windows are created
by passing an existing window as the value of the
<code>:owner</code> keyword argument to <a href="operators/cg/m/make-window.htm"><b>make-window</b></a>, and true as the value
of the <code>:child-p</code> argument. (Note that the
<code>:child-p</code> argument defaults to t, so it's not
necessary to specify a value when creating a child window.)
</li>
<li id="158">
Owned top-level windows, where the owner is a window but the parent is
the screen. These windows appear to be independent, moving freely
about on the desktop (screen), but still have an owner window with
which they shrink and so on. Such windows are created by passing an
existing window as the value of the <code>:owner</code> argument
to <a href="operators/cg/m/make-window.htm"><b>make-window</b></a>,
and passing <code>nil</code> as the value of the
<code>:child-p</code> argument. Note that the owner of an owned
top-level window must always be a top-level window; if a child window
is passed as the owner, its top-level parent (or ancestor) will become
the owner, not the child window specified.
</li>
<li id="159">
Non-owned top-level windows, where both the owner and parent are
the screen. These windows are truly independent, and have their own
icons in the Windows taskbar and alt-tab window (unless their 
<a href="operators/cg/b/border.htm"><b>border</b></a>
property is :palette). Create a non-owned top-level window by passing
<code>(screen *system*)</code> as the value of the 
<code>:owner</code> argument to 
<a href="operators/cg/m/make-window.htm"><b>make-window</b></a>
(in which case the <code>:child-</code>p argument will be 
essentially ignored).
</li>
</ol>
<p id="160">
In the IDE, the default value of the <code>:owner</code>
argument to <a href="operators/cg/m/make-window.htm"><b>make-window</b></a> is
<code>(development-main-window *system*)</code>, which is the
owner window of the various IDE dialogs (see <a href="operators/cg/d/development-main-window.htm"><b>development-main-window</b></a>
and <a href="variables/cg/s_system_s.htm"><code>*system*</code></a>). This default allows a
user-created window to access the IDE menubar commands by using the
menubar's keyboard shortcuts when the user-created window has the
keyboard focus, and also allows the window to intermingle with the
various IDE windows, rather than being either behind all of the IDE
windows or in front of all of them. In a generated standalone
application, on the other hand, the default value of the
<code>:owner</code> argument is the screen. So to test a
top-level window just as it would behave in a standalone application,
specify <code>(screen *system*)</code> as the owner of the
window rather than letting the owner default to the IDE owner window.
These two alternatives are used by the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/run-menu.htm#run-form">Run Form</a> and <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/run-menu.htm#run-project">Run
Project</a> commands (both on the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/run-menu.htm">Run</a> menu): The 
<a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/run-menu.htm#run-form">Run Form</a> command places the
running window on the IDE owner window for easy access within the IDE,
whereas the  <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/run-menu.htm#run-project">Run
Project</a> command creates the main window of the project
on the screen to more closely emulate the standalone application that
would be created from the project.
</p>
<p id="161">
The IDE is multi-threaded, so you may find that a user
window created on the IDE owner window leads to "message timeout"
errors if it interacts with IDE windows in certain ways, due to the
windows having been created in different processes and therefore
handling their messages in those different processes. If this should
happen, the workaround is to not create those user windows on the IDE
owner window.
</p>
<p id="162">
Some related functions: <a href="operators/cg/p/parent.htm"><b>parent</b></a> returns the parent of a
window, while <a href="operators/cg/o/owner.htm"><b>owner</b></a> returns the owner.  <a href="operators/cg/w/windows.htm"><b>windows</b></a> returns a list of
all of the child or owned windows of a window.  <a href="operators/cg/c/child-p.htm"><b>child-p</b></a> returns whether a window is
a child window. <a href="operators/cg/t/top-level-window.htm"><b>top-level-window</b></a> returns the
top-level ancestor window of a window.
</p>
<h3 id="163">
Some Notes
</h3>
<ul>
<li id="164">
Because the <code>:owner</code> argument was inappropriately
called <code>:parent</code> in earlier releases (inappropriate
because the argument was only an owner and not a parent when creating
an owned top-level window), the <code>:parent</code> argument
still works for compatibility, but <code>:owner</code> is
preferred.
</li>

<li id="165">
In earlier releases, passing the <code>:pop-up</code> argument
to <a href="operators/cg/m/make-window.htm"><b>make-window</b></a> as true
simply created a top-level window. Now it more specifically creates a
top-level window appropriate for use as a modal dialog, by coercing
<code>:child-p</code> to <code>nil</code>,
<code>:state</code> to <code>:shrunk</code>,
<code>:minimize-button</code> and
<code>:maximize-button</code> to <code>nil</code>,
and <code>:scrollbars</code> to <code>nil</code>.
</li>
</ul>

<hr><hr><h2 id="166"><a name="code-creating-controls-1">8.0 About how to get sample code for creating controls</a></h2>

<p id="167">
All controls (buttons, single-item-lists, combo-boxes,

created with <a href="../ansicl/dictentr/make-ins.htm"><b>make-instance</b></a>, which takes a class
name and initialization arguments.
</p>
<p id="168">
Using the IDE, you can add a control to a form. The code for creating
an instance of the control is generated automatically. That
automatically generated code provides examples of code that creates

<p id="180">
Multiple application processes can create CG windows, where each
process will handle all events for the windows that it creates.
</p>
<p id="181">
We advise against creating windows in multiple processes within a 
single window hierarchy, though, because deadlocks may occur when
messages are sent from a window in one process to a window in 
another process within the hierarchy. 
</p>
<p id="182">
The generic function <a href="operators/cg/c/creation-process.htm"><b>creation-process</b></a> applied to a
window returns the process that called <a href="operators/cg/m/make-window.htm"><b>make-window</b></a> to create the window.
</p>
<p id="183">
The function <a href="operators/cg/s/set-foreground-window.htm"><b>set-foreground-window</b></a>
makes the process that created the specified window be
the foreground process, and selects the specified window.
</p>
<p id="184">
A process that is to create windows must be set up as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li id="185">
When creating the process by calling <a href="operators/mp/process-run-function.htm"><b>process-run-function</b></a>, pass <a href="variables/cg/s_default-cg-bindings_s.htm"><code>*default-cg-bindings*</code></a> as the value
of the :initial-bindings keyword argument. If other bindings are
needed, a union of those bindings with <a href="variables/cg/s_default-cg-bindings_s.htm"><code>*default-cg-bindings*</code></a> may be
passed, but of course do not modify the <a href="variables/cg/s_default-cg-bindings_s.htm"><code>*default-cg-bindings*</code></a> list.
</li>
<li id="186">
At the end of the preset-function passed to <a href="operators/mp/process-run-function.htm"><b>process-run-function</b></a>, enter an
event-handling loop by calling <a href="operators/cg/e/event-loop.htm"><b>event-loop</b></a>. This allows any
messages that are sent to windows that are created in this process to
be handled. Typically a "main window" is passed to <a href="operators/cg/e/event-loop.htm"><b>event-loop</b></a> so that the event-loop
and its process will exit when the user has closed the specified
window.
</li>
</ol>

<p id="187">
A convenient way to do the above two steps is to use the macro <a href="operators/cg/i/in-cg-process.htm"><b>in-cg-process</b></a>.
</p>

<p id="188">
These steps are not necessary when using the project system to create
an application with a single windowing process (which is typical),
because these steps are done automatically for the process created by
the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/run-menu.htm#run-project">Run | Run Project</a> command in the IDE and by
the corresponding initial process of the generated standalone

which handles the actual user gestures in the IDE such as mouse

<hr><h2 id="217"><a name="using-ide-when-busy-2">9.5 Using the IDE while user code is busy</a></h2>

<p id="218">
Multiple processes are used by the IDE to allow IDE windows to be
responsive while arbitrary user code is busy executing. This is
accomplished by creating all of the IDE windows in the "IDE GUI"
process, but evaluating user code in an IDE Listener process such as the
initial "Listener 1" process, which is associated with the Debug
window. The listener processes are used not only for evalutions in the
listener pane itself, but also by IDE commands that involve user code,
such as the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/tools-menu.htm">Tools</a> |
<a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/tools-menu.htm#incremental-evaluation">Incremental Evaluation</a> and
<a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/file-menu.htm">File</a> | <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/file-menu.htm#load">Load</a>
commands.
</p>
<p id="219">
The IDE windows will not respond at all while a listener process is
busy, however, if there are any open user windows (windows that were
created in a listener process) on the IDE owner window (see <a href="operators/cg/d/development-main-window.htm"><b>development-main-window</b></a>).
There are two cases (described below) where a user window may
commonly end up on the IDE owner window, and so these cases should be
avoided (and any existing user windows on the IDE owner should be
closed) at times when it is desirable to use IDE windows while user
code is busy running.
</p>
<p id="220">
The first case is the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/run-menu.htm">Run</a> | <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/run-menu.htm#run-form">Run Form</a> command. <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/run-menu.htm#run-form">Run
Form</a> creates the running window in an IDE listener process,
with the IDE owner window as the owner. This is done so that
particular IDE windows may be used alongside the running window
without bringing the entire IDE in front of the running window, and so
that keyboard shortcuts for IDE commands may be used while the running
window is selected. <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/run-menu.htm#run-project">Run Project</a> (also on the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/run-menu.htm">Run</a> menu), on the other hand,
does not use the IDE owner window, since its purpose is to simulate
the final standalone application more closely. So if a widget on a
dialog of the current project initiates a long procedure, and it is
desirable to use the IDE while this procedure is running, you should
use <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/run-menu.htm#run-project">Run Project</a> rather than <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/run-menu.htm#run-form">Run
Form</a>. (If you need to interrupt something that is running and
the IDE windows are not responsive, you can still do so by
right-clicking the Franz icon in the Windows Tray and selecting
"Interrupt Lisp".)
</p>
<p id="221">
The second case involves arbitrary user calls to <a href="operators/cg/m/make-window.htm"><b>make-window</b></a> where no :owner
argument is specified. When this is done in the IDE, the owner of the
new window defaults to the IDE owner window. This default is used for
the same reasons as <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/run-menu.htm#run-form">Run Form</a> above. If it is desirable to use the
IDE while such a window is open and while user code is busy running,
then the window should be created with the screen as its owner by
specifying the value of the :owner argument to <a href="operators/cg/m/make-window.htm"><b>make-window</b></a> as <code>(screen
*system*)</code>.  See <a href="operators/cg/s/screen.htm"><b>screen</b></a> and <a href="variables/cg/s_system_s.htm"><code>*system*</code></a>.

<hr><hr><h2 id="223"><a name="cg-event-driven-design-1">10.0 About design considerations for event-driven applications</a></h2>

<p id="224">
As documented in <a href="#cg-multithreading-1">Section 9.0 About using multiple windowing processes in a Common Graphics application</a>
above, any process that is set up to create windows and handle the
messages that are sent to them needs to call <a href="operators/cg/e/event-loop.htm"><b>event-loop</b></a> at the end of its
<a href="operators/mp/process-run-function.htm"><b>process-run-function</b></a>
preset-function. The process will then spend its remaining time inside
<a href="operators/cg/e/event-loop.htm"><b>event-loop</b></a>,
running code that is triggered by the messages that are sent to any
windows that are created in that process. The messages include user
mouse and keyboard events as well as messages sent by code that the
application is running and messages from the operating system.
</p>
<p id="225">
This interactive event-driven model requires an application to be
designed somewhat differently than one that simply runs from start to
end to complete a pre-defined task. We describe two kinds of potential
problems that are good to keep in mind when designing an interactive
Common Graphics application: <a href="#mh-routines-run-long-2">problems with message-handling routines
that run for a long time</a> and <a href="#mh-routines-that-block-2">problems with message-handling routines
that block</a>.
</p>

<hr><h2 id="226"><a name="mh-routines-run-long-2">10.1 Message-handling routines that run for a long time</a></h2>


<p id="227">
When mouse and keyboard events (and other messages) are sent to
various windows of a Common Graphics application, the messages are
held in a queue, and generally the application code that handles each
message is run completely before the next message in the queue is
handled. This allows the code to run in a predictable order, even
though the messages themselves are queued asynchronously.
</p>
<p id="228">
This can be a problem when the code that handles a message runs for a
long time, because no other messages for windows in the same process
will be handled until that code returns, and so end users will see no
response to their gestures in the meantime.  If future user actions
might depend on the current routine completing, then not much can be
done about this except showing an hourglass cursor (see <a href="operators/cg/w/with-hourglass.htm"><b>with-hourglass</b></a>) or using
other cues to tell the user to wait. In this default case, further
messages will be queued and handled later in order, and this is how
most windowing applications work.
</p>
<p id="229">
But sometimes it is desirable for the user to be able to go ahead and
perform other independent actions (when there are any). One way to do
this is to call <a href="operators/mp/process-run-function.htm"><b>process-run-function</b></a> to create a
new process that performs the time-consuming operation.  Note that if
the new process needs to create windows that will handle messages,
then it needs to follow the guidelines for creating a Common Graphics
process described in
<a href="#cg-multithreading-1">Section 9.0 About using multiple windowing processes in a Common Graphics application</a> above; otherwise
any ordinary process may be created and used. Another general option
is to hand off a command to an existing process, perhaps with
process-interrupt or using a custom queue of some sort.
</p>
<p id="230">
A different approach is to call <a href="operators/cg/p/process-pending-events.htm"><b>process-pending-events</b></a> at frequent
intervals in the long-running code, which handles subsequent queued
messages at that time. This function can cause unknown messages to be
handled in a different order than usual, though, and so it should be
used with care.
</p>
<p id="231">
<a href="operators/cg/p/process-pending-events.htm"><b>process-pending-events</b></a> should not
be called when an exclusive resource (such as a process lock) is
currently being held, if it is possible that the processing of
subsequent events may lead to a request for that resource that will
block until the resource is no longer held. If it is the same process
that requests the resource again, then this would always cause a
deadlock, since the process will not unwind to the earlier use of the
resource in order to free it (unless the second request knows how to
see that that process already has the resource, and then either
proceed or return, as appropriate).  Even if the second request is
from another process, complex interactions could still lead to
deadlock unless this is carefully avoided in the application design.
</p>
<p id="232">
Similarly, a Common Graphics process that an application creates
normally should not grab an exclusive resource in its <a href="operators/mp/process-run-function.htm"><b>process-run-function</b></a>
preset-function and not release it before it calls <a href="operators/cg/e/event-loop.htm"><b>event-loop</b></a>, as this would hoard the
resource for the entire life of the process. Likewise, a project's
<a href="operators/ide/on-initialization.htm"><b>on-initialization</b></a>
function should avoid returning while holding an exclusive resource.
</p>
<p id="233">
With either of the above approaches (handing a long-running command
off to another process, or calling <a href="operators/cg/p/process-pending-events.htm"><b>process-pending-events</b></a> frequently),
it is up to the application to prevent the user from doing an action
that depends on the result of an earlier action that has not yet
completed.
</p>



<hr><h2 id="234"><a name="mh-routines-that-block-2">10.2 Message-handling routines that block</a></h2>

<p id="235">
A less obvious kind of problem may arise due to the fact that there
are certain other exceptions to the general rule where one message is
handled completely before the next message is handled.  In particular,
there are certain functions such as <a href="operators/mp/process-wait.htm"><b>process-wait</b></a> that wait an arbitrary
amount of time until some condition is met (this is usually called
blocking). When such functions are called in a Common Graphics
process, any messages that were already queued or that occur during
the waiting period are handled while the call is blocking.
</p>
<p id="236">
This handling of further messages during blocking is done to avoid
failing to respond to arbitrary messages for long periods, including
messages sent by other processes, or messages that the operating
system may send to all top-level windows, expecting a timely reply.
Also, the process may be waiting on a condition that will not be
reached until further messages are handled by that same process, and
so the process would be hung if further messages were not handled
while blocking.
</p>
<p id="237">
This design means that when a blocking function is called in code that
is itself handling a message, later messages are handled while the
code handling the current message is still running, and so the
messages are not handled totally in the usual order.  In particular,
if the same type of message occurs again during the waiting period,
the code that handles the message may be re-entered a number of
times, which the application may not be written to handle.
</p>
<p id="238">
And normally almost all Common Graphics code in an application is
message-handling code (namely everything except the <a href="operators/ide/on-initialization.htm"><b>on-initialization</b></a> function of a
standalone application, or setup code that a newly-created Common
Graphics process calls before it calls <a href="operators/cg/e/event-loop.htm"><b>event-loop</b></a>).  So this warning
applies to nearly all Common Graphics code in a typical application,
if it calls blocking functions that process intervening messages.
</p>
<p id="239">
The functions and macros that cause intervening messages to be handled
immediately include the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li id="240">
<a href="operators/mp/process-wait.htm"><b>process-wait</b></a>
</li>
<li id="241">
<a href="operators/mp/with-process-lock.htm"><b>with-process-lock</b></a>
</li>
<li id="242">
<a href="../ansicl/dictentr/sleep.htm"><b>sleep</b></a>
</li>
<li id="243">
<a href="operators/cg/p/process-pending-events.htm"><b>process-pending-events</b></a>
</li>
<li id="244">
<b>astore:with-transaction</b> (in AllegroStore applications)
</li>
</ul>

<p id="245">
Other functions (either in Allegro itself or in the application) that
call the above functions would exhibit this behavior as well, and
there may be other primitive functions in Allegro that behave this way
but are not noted here.
</p>
<p id="246">
A particular kind of deadlock can result if one of these functions is
called while holding an exclusive resource of some kind, such as a
process lock.  For example, say an application has a <a href="operators/cg/m/mouse-in.htm"><b>mouse-in</b></a> method that grabs a
process lock and then calls either <a href="operators/mp/process-wait.htm"><b>process-wait</b></a> or <a href="operators/cg/p/process-pending-events.htm"><b>process-pending-events</b></a>. If the user
moves the mouse into a window a second time and that event is handled
while the call to the method for the first <a href="operators/cg/m/mouse-in.htm"><b>mouse-in</b></a> is still inside the call
to <a href="operators/mp/process-wait.htm"><b>process-wait</b></a>

<a href="operators/cg/m/mouse-in.htm"><b>mouse-in</b></a> method
will be re-entered and wait for the lock. This will deadlock (with
the default arguments to <a href="operators/mp/with-process-lock.htm"><b>with-process-lock</b></a>) because that
event-handling process will wait for the lock forever and therefore
never unwind to the first call to the <a href="operators/cg/m/mouse-in.htm"><b>mouse-in</b></a> method, as it would need

The function <a href="operators/cg/p/post-funcall-in-cg-process.htm"><b>post-funcall-in-cg-process</b></a> has been
supplied as a general single-process solution to this kind of problem.
If code that calls any of the blocking functions listed above is
passed to this function instead of being called directly, then the
code will be run later after all window messages in this process have
been handled and all code that was queued by earlier calls to this
function have run and returned. The important point is that all
function calls that are passed to <a href="operators/cg/p/post-funcall-in-cg-process.htm"><b>post-funcall-in-cg-process</b></a> for a
given process are guarranteed to run sequentially (in the order of
posting), eliminating problems that might arise if the calls
overlapped.  See <a href="operators/cg/p/post-funcall-in-cg-process.htm"><b>post-funcall-in-cg-process</b></a> for more
information and an example.  Further window messages are handled as
usual by the process whenever a queued function is not running, and
users will still see response to their interactive gestures while
posted function calls are queued or blocking.

<hr><hr><h2 id="254"><a name="noproject-app-1">12.0 About creating a Standalone Common Graphics Application without using the Project System</a></h2>

<p id="255">
A Common Graphics application is typically built as a project in the
IDE, and then turned into a standalone application with the IDE's
<a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/file-menu.htm#build-project-distribution">File | Build Project
Distribution</a>. See <a href="cg/ide-ug/ide_user_guide_4.htm">Chapter 4:
Projects</a> of the <a href="cg/ide-ug/ide_user_guide_1.htm">Ide User Guide</a>
for information on using projects to create appplications.
</p>
<p id="256">
You can also create a standalone Common Graphics application with a
direct call to <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a>, but you must make sure
you do everything that needs to be done correctly. Most importantly,
note that it is <b>not</b> sufficient to specify as a value for the
<code>:restart-app-function</code> or
<code>:restart-init-function</code> argument (to <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a>) a function
that would work as the <a href="operators/ide/on-initialization.htm"><b>on-initialization</b></a> function of a project.
Instead, the restart function must do additional setup that would have
been handled automatically by the project system.  Generally, the
restart function should do the following:
</p>

<ol>
<li id="257">
Call <a href="operators/cg/i/initialize-cg.htm"><b>initialize-cg</b></a>.
</li>
<li id="258">
Create any initial windows and other setup that would be done by a
project's <a href="operators/ide/on-initialization.htm"><b>on-initialization</b></a> function.
</li>
<li id="259">
Call <a href="operators/cg/e/event-loop.htm"><b>event-loop</b></a>
to handle events until the application exits.
</li>
<li id="260">
Call <a href="operators/excl/exit.htm"><b>excl:exit</b></a>,
passing the return code that was returned from the call to event-loop.
</li>
</ol>

<p id="261">
In addition, the :pre-load-form argument to <a href="operators/excl/generate-application.htm"><b>generate-application</b></a> should require any needed
Common Graphics modules, since these will not be included
automatically as the project system would do.
</p>


<hr><hr><h2 id="262"><a name="position-class-1">13.0 About the position class</a></h2>

<p id="263">
Because of a design flaw which is hard to back out of,
there is a class named <code>position</code> which is the class
of position objects in Common Graphics. This is a design flaw because
<code>position</code> is a Common Lisp symbol (naming a sequence
function). It is actually outside the ANSI spec to overload Common
Lisp symbols with additional functionality. However, because the
violation is not very serious and because changing it would involve
substantial costs, we have decided to leave the class
<code>position</code> rather than renaming it.
</p>
<p id="264">
The <code>position</code> class is documented here because we
arrange our documentation by package and documenting the
<code>position</code> class with other Common Lisp symbols is
inappropriate.
</p>
<p id="265">
The <code>position</code> class is the class of position
objects. A position is created with <a href="operators/cg/m/make-position.htm"><b>make-position</b></a>, and indicates a
location in some coordinate system by specifying its x and y
coordinates. Positions are useful for determining such things as a
window's location or where to draw something on a graphical stream.

<p id="267">
An artifact left over from a very early release of Common Graphics is
various mathematical functions named
<i>i&lt;cl-math-function&gt;</i>. In the very earliest release, these
were quite fast on Windows machines because they used 16-bit
arithmetic. With the release of 5.0, the 16-bit operators were
replaced by corresponding regular Common Lisp math functions with
wrapped declarations identifying the arguments as fixnums. These were
named by symbols in the <code>aclwin</code> package and were not
documented. These symbols are now
in the cg package. Because we document all exported symbols in that
package, we document the <i>i&lt;cl-math-function&gt;</i> operators
here. They are defined for backward compatibility only. Please do not
use them in new code. Instead, use the Common Lisp function determined
by removing the initial <b>i</b> from the symbol name.

It is, of course, possible to write a Windows program that makes
direct calls to the Windows API and does not use Common Graphics.
Below is an example of a trivial but complete program written using
Allegro CL's foreign function interface to the Windows API. Writing
directly in the Windows API may be useful if you want to port an
existing Windows program from C, or if you want the application to be
smaller than it would be if it included Common Graphics.
</p>
<p id="288">
This program simply creates a window that draws a box inside itself,
but it illustrates how to set up the usual basic structure of a
Windows program in Allegro CL.  This example runs in a base lisp that
does not include Common Graphics. (Note that the package is the
<b>cl-user</b> package, not the <b>cg-user</b> package -- which may
not exist in the base Lisp. If you run this program in the IDE, be
sure to use the <b>cl-user::</b> package qualifier when necessary.)

<hr><hr><h2 id="290"><a name="east-asian-chars-1">Appendix B: Displaying East Asian Characters in Common Graphics and the IDE in Microsoft Windows</a></h2>

<p id="291">
If you are using East Asian character sets (such as Hangul, Hiragana,
or Kanji) on Microsoft Windows in the IDE or a CG application, and the
characters are not being drawn or handled properly, here are three
things that you should check.  The first two are global Control Panel
settings, and the third is ensuring that CG or the IDE is using fonts
that supports the character set.
</p>
<p id="292">
The two Control Panel settings are both in the <b>Regional and
Language Options</b> dialog, and they must be set before lisp is
started.  The following descriptions apply to the XP version of this
dialog; the tabs or widgets may be named differently in other versions
of Windows.
</p>
<ol>
<li id="293">

On the <b>Regional Options</b> tab, select the desired language in the
upper drop-down box (in the <b>Standards and formats</b> group box).
This sets the default locale, though the dialog doesn't tell you that.
This is necessary for lisp to convert C string pointers into the
proper unicode strings and vice versa, such as when reading a string
from a text edit control, or placing a string into a control
programmatically.

</li>
<li id="294">

On the <b>Advanced</b> tab, select the desired language as the
language for non-Unicode programs.  This will require a reboot when
you exit the dialog.  This seems to be necessary for CG to correctly
draw East Asian characters even when everything else is set up
correctly.  We suspect that the reason is that CG always uses the ANSI
version of Windows API functions rather than the unicode versions,
even in the International version of Allegro where all lisp strings
are unicode.

</li>
</ol>

<p id="295">
The third consideration is that Common Graphics may need to use a
particular font that supports the desired character set.  We noticed
this to be true for Hiragana and Kanji but not for Hangul, so we will
refer specifically to Japanese characters here.
</p>
<p id="296">
Microsoft controls appear to automatically switch their font to one
that has a Japanese script as needed so that they can display Hiragana
or Kanji characters correctly.  So a widget such as a <a href="classes/cg/button.htm"><code>button</code></a>, <a href="classes/cg/static-text.htm"><code>static-text</code></a>, or <a href="classes/cg/multi-line-editable-text.htm"><code>multi-line-editable-text</code></a> will probably work no
matter what is official font is.  (A <a href="classes/cg/text-edit-pane.htm"><code>text-edit-pane</code></a> window uses the same Microsoft
control as a <a href="classes/cg/multi-line-editable-text.htm"><code>multi-line-editable-text</code></a> widget, and so it will
work as well.)  But when CG draws text on a regular window that is
not a Microsoft control, it simply uses the window's current font, and
if the script of this font is not Japanese, then it will not draw
Japanese characters correctly.
</p>
<p id="297">
To fix this problem in the IDE, you probably just need to show the
<a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/tools-menu.htm#options">Tools |
Options</a> dialog, go to the <b>Fonts</b> tab, and change the
<b>Default Proportional</b> font (on the upper right button) to one
that has a Japanese script.  You may find that the <b>System</b> font
face is the only proportional font that has a Japanese script.  (See
the script choices in the widget toward the bottom of the font dialog
to tell if a particular font face has a Japanese script option.)  So
you could change the IDE's <b>Default Proportional</b> font to the
"system" font face, making sure that the Japanese script is also
selected in the font dialog.
</p>
<p id="298">
Assuming that you haven't changed the inspector fonts or the other
fonts listed below the <b>Default Proportional</b> font on the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/options-dialog.htm">Options dialog</a> dialog,
then that column of IDE fonts should all change to the same font, and
Hiragana and Kanji characters should begin displaying correctly in the
inspector and any other IDE windows that are not Microsoft controls.
Otherwise you can press the buttons for the other IDE fonts in that
column and agree to make them default once again to the default
proportional font.
</p>
<p id="299">
The <b>Default Fixed-Width</b> font is initially
<code>FixedSys</code>, which does have a Japanese script in our
tests, and so you probably don't need to change that one.  But if it
is set to a font face that does not have a Japanese script, or the
Japanese script is not selected for the font, then you'll need to
change that one as well, plus the other fixed-width fonts below that
one on the <a href="ide-menus-and-dialogs/options-dialog.htm">Options
dialog</a> dialog if you have changed them individually.
</p>
<p id="300">
Similarly, if you are writing a Common Graphics application and need
to display Japanese characters, you will need to call <a href="operators/cg/f/font.htm"><b>(setf font)</b></a> to set the
font of your application's windows to one that has a Japanese script.
