Common Graphics uses various terms to describe different ways that it
measures coordinates in various contexts, such as window units and
stream units. These terms denote coordinates that differ in two ways:
</p><ol>
<li id="5">the size of the basic unit of distance
</li>
<li id="6">
the location of the origin point, where x and y are both zero
</li>
</ol><p id="7">
The following two sections,
<a href="#cs-units-of-size-1">Section 1.0 Coordinate System Unit of Size</a>, and
<a href="#cs-location-of-origin-1">Section 2.0 Coordinate System Location of Origin</a>, explain each
type of difference.
</p><hr><hr><h2 id="8"><a name="cs-units-of-size-1">1.0 Coordinate System Unit of Size</a></h2>
<p id="9">
Distances, offsets, and sizes in common graphics are usually
measured in pixels. For example, the 
<a href="../operators/cg/l/left.htm"><b>left</b></a> property of a window is
expressed as the number of pixels that fit in a horizontal line
between the window's exterior left edge and the interior left edge of
its parent window. These pixel-based measurements are referred to as
being in device units, since their size depends on the resolution of
the display device.
</p>
<p id="10">
One alternative to measuring in pixel units is to use dialog units,
where one dialog unit is equal to one-fourth of a system font
character width or one-eighth of a system font character
height. Common Graphics allows for the size of a control to be
specified in dialog units (by passing the :dialog-units-p initarg to
make-instance (or <a href="../operators/cg/m/make-window.htm"><b>make-window</b></a>) when creating the
control), but we discourage the use of dialog units since the system
font (provided by the video display adapter driver) is no longer
commonly used, and because common graphics measures arbitrary drawing
positions and font sizes and so on in pixels, and it's easier to fit
all parts of a graphical interface together if the same units are used
for everything.
</p>
<p id="11">
The other alternative to pixel-size device units is to use a
scaling-stream. A scaling stream class is any class that is a subclass
of <a href="../classes/cg/graphical-stream.htm"><code>graphical-stream</code></a> and also a
subclass of the <a href="../classes/cg/scaling-stream.htm"><code>scaling-stream</code></a> mixin class. The
basic unit of distance of a scaling stream is initially device units
but may be set to any arbitrary size by calling (setf <a href="../operators/cg/s/stream-units-per-inch.htm"><b>stream-units-per-inch</b></a>) or
(setf <a href="../operators/cg/s/stream-units-per-mm.htm"><b>stream-units-per-mm</b></a>). 
</p>
<p id="12">
The only scaling stream class that common graphics supplies is the
<a href="../classes/cg/printer.htm"><code>printer</code></a> class,
but an application may create and use scaling window classes if it is
desired to draw in windows using coordinates expressed in some unit
other than pixels. It is particularly useful to scale a printer stream
to use the same <a href="../operators/cg/s/stream-units-per-inch.htm"><b>stream-units-per-inch</b></a>
as a window. Then the same drawing code can be used to draw on both
the window and the printer at the same size, without the application
code needing to scale its own coordinates for each call to a drawing
function. This can be achieved by evaluating
</p>
<pre id="13">
(setf (stream-units-per-inch my-printer-stream)
      (stream-units-per-inch my-window))
</pre>
<p id="14">
Note: this technique may cause fatter-than-desired lines since line
thicknesses and so on are still limited to integral stream-unit values
even though 1 stream-unit of thickness may now be many device pixels
thick. Drawing glitches might also occur due to floating-point
round-off in the scaling conversion. You also may need to add a
fudge factor to this expression, though, since the operating system
does not actually know how big the monitor is, and typically estimates
it badly. Multiplying by 0.85 is suggested.
</p>
<p id="15">
The functions <a href="../operators/cg/d/device-to-scaling-units.htm"><b>device-to-scaling-units</b></a> and <a href="../operators/cg/s/scaling-to-device-units.htm"><b>scaling-to-device-units</b></a>
can be used to translate between scaled and non-scaled positions and
boxes.

<p id="17">
<b>Stream coordinates</b> are the application-level coordinates that are
normally used for specifying drawing positions on a drawing "stream",
which could be either a window or a printer stream or some other
two-dimensional output stream. Stream coordinates are also used for
specifying child window locations and other application-level
positions except where otherwise noted. 
</p>
<p id="18">
Each coordinate indicates the
distance rightward or downward from an arbitrary stream-origin. For
example, if the stream-origin of a stream is (100, 200), then the
leftmost x coordinate in the entire "page" (or canvas) that can be
drawn into for the stream will be -100, the topmost y coordinate will
be -200, the rightmost x coordinate will be
</p>

<pre id="19">
(- (page-width stream) 100)
</pre>

<p id="20">
and the bottommost y coordinate will be 
</p>

<pre id="21">
(- (page-height stream) 200)
</pre>

<p id="22">
The function <a href="../operators/cg/s/stream-to-stream-units.htm"><b>stream-to-stream-units</b></a> translates
coordinates in one stream to be relative to another stream; this can
be done only if the two streams have a common ancestor, such as with
windows on a screen, since otherwise no relationship between the two
coordinate systems is defined. 
</p>
<p id="23">
<b>Page coordinates</b> are stream coordinates with the arbitrary
stream-origin added on, and so each coordinate indicates a distance
rightward or downward from the upper-left corner of the entire "page"
(or canvas) that is being drawn on. The <a href="../operators/cg/s/stream-origin.htm"><b>stream-origin</b></a> is usually left at
its default position of (0, 0) and so page coordinates are usually the
same as stream coordinates. But an application may, for example, find
it useful to move the stream origin in order to draw a polygon at
various places on the page without modifying the individual vertices
of the polygon. 
</p>
<p id="24">
Only the origin itself is specified in page
coordinates; elsewhere stream coordinates should suffice for "user"
positions and device coordinates (introduced next) for "physical"
positions. 
</p>
<p id="25">
<b>Device coordinates</b> are page coordinates unscaled and unscrolled; that
is, they are always measured in pixels (which are what a "device" such
as a screen or printer uses itself), and are relative to the
upper-left corner of some "physical" device such as a printed page or
window interior. (Actually stream and page coordinates are usually
measured in pixels as well, except when the stream is a <a href="../classes/cg/scaling-stream.htm"><code>scaling-stream</code></a>, for
which an arbitrary unit of size may be established. A <a href="../classes/cg/printer.htm"><code>printer</code></a> stream is always
a scaling-stream, and a window is a scaling-stream if an application
has mixed the <a href="../classes/cg/scaling-stream.htm"><code>scaling-stream</code></a> class into the
window's class.)  
</p>
<p id="26">
The functions <a href="../operators/cg/s/stream-to-device-units.htm"><b>stream-to-device-units</b></a> and <a href="../operators/cg/d/device-to-stream-units.htm"><b>device-to-stream-units</b></a>
translate between stream and device coordinates. 
</p>
<p id="27">
When working in a
window, device coordinates are also called window coordinates and are
relative to the upper-left of the physical window interior rather than
to the upper-left of the virtual canvas (or page) on which the
application draws.
</p>
<p id="28">
The functions <a href="../operators/cg/s/stream-to-device-units.htm"><b>stream-to-device-units</b></a> and <a href="../operators/cg/d/device-to-stream-units.htm"><b>device-to-stream-units</b></a>
translate between stream and window coordinates just as they do with
device coordinates generally. The function <a href="../operators/cg/w/window-to-window-units.htm"><b>window-to-window-units</b></a> translates
window coordinates of one window into window coordinates of another
window. 
</p>
<p id="29">
When working in a window or on the screen itself, screen
coordinates are relative to the upper-left corner of the physical
screen. The functions <a href="../operators/cg/w/window-to-screen-units.htm"><b>window-to-screen-units</b></a> and <a href="../operators/cg/s/screen-to-window-units.htm"><b>screen-to-window-units</b></a>
translate between window and screen coordinates.
