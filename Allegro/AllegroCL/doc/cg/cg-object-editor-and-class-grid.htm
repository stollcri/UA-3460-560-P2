Common Graphics includes two types of interface objects that make it
easy to browse and edit instances of classes. The instances are
typically stored in databases, but they do not need to be.
</p>
<p id="6">
One of these interface objects is the <a href="../classes/cg/class-grid.htm"><code>class-grid</code></a> widget.  This is a specialized
<a href="../classes/cg/grid-widget.htm"><code>grid-widget</code></a> that has a
column for each application slot of interest and a row for each
instance that you tell it to display.
</p>
<p id="7">
The other interface object is the <a href="../classes/cg/object-editor.htm"><code>object-editor</code></a> dialog. It has a standalone widget
for each edited slot of a single currently-displayed instance, as well
as a number of standard command buttons for displaying different
instances and saving edits to them and so on.
</p>

<hr><hr><h2 id="8"><a name="creating-1">2.0 Creating object-editors and class-grids</a></h2>

<p id="9">
To create these interface objects, you do not need to create the
individual grid columns or widgets from scratch.  Instead, you specify
a special expression as the <a href="../operators/cg/e/edited-slots.htm"><b>edited-slots</b></a> property of the <a href="../classes/cg/class-grid.htm"><code>class-grid</code></a> or <a href="../classes/cg/object-editor.htm"><code>object-editor</code></a>. The <a href="../operators/cg/e/edited-slots.htm"><b>edited-slots</b></a> property is list of slot
specifications. Each slot specification is a list where the first
member is the name of a slot to edit, and the rest of the list is a
plist of attributes that indicate what sort of values are in the slot
and what sort of widgets should be used to edit them.  A <a href="../classes/cg/class-grid.htm"><code>class-grid</code></a> will automatically
create its grid columns from this specification, and an <a href="../classes/cg/object-editor.htm"><code>object-editor</code></a> will automatically
create and arrange its widgets.
</p>
<p id="10">
Typically you would pass an <a href="../operators/cg/e/edited-slots.htm"><b>edited-slots</b></a> list when creating either a <a href="../classes/cg/class-grid.htm"><code>class-grid</code></a> or an <a href="../classes/cg/object-editor.htm"><code>object-editor</code></a>, something like this:
</p>

<pre id="11">
  :edited-slots
  '((date-of-birth
     :edited-type (:date :yyyy/mm/dd)
     :label "Birth Date")
    (favorite-color
     :edited-type (:single-choice (:red :green :blue :yellow))
     :on-print capitalize-object
     :label "Fave Color")
    (best-friend
     :edited-type (:class-instance patient)
     :width 140))
</pre>

<p id="12">
Though writing a single edited-slots expression is easier than
defining a set of widgets or grid columns, there are still a fair
number of options to remember (or look up).  To avoid even writing an
edited-slots expression, an alternative is to use the IDE's <a href="../ide-menus-and-dialogs/class-interface-editor-dialog.htm">Class Interface
Editor</a> to specify the edited slots interactively.  This
document covers the programmatic approach; for the interactive
approach see the doc page for the <a href="../ide-menus-and-dialogs/class-interface-editor-dialog.htm">Class Interface Editor</a>
dialog.

The code below illustrates making a standalone class-grid and then an
<a href="../classes/cg/object-editor.htm"><code>object-editor</code></a> that contains
a <a href="../classes/cg/class-grid.htm"><code>class-grid</code></a>.  Most of the
code here is actually for setting up some sample classes with
instances.  This example uses an AllegroCache database, though that's
not necessary.
