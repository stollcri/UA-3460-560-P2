1. LICENSE. Franz Inc. ("Franz") hereby grants you (each licensee is
   addressed as "you") a non-exclusive, transferable license to use
   its accompanying software product known as "Allegro CL Free

   object code, accompanying source code [if any] provided by Franz,
   and documentation are collectively referred to as the "Software") on
   the following terms and only for non-commercial purposes (see
   Section 2 below). You may:

  a. use the Software on any computer in your possession;

  b. make copies of the Software; and

  c. distribute the Software (subject to the requirements of Section 3
     below) only in the form originally furnished by Franz with no
     modifications or additions whatsoever. If you have the slightest
     doubt that your copy of the Software is not original, you must
     contact Franz for an original copy. You may, however, distribute
     additional programming code in source form only, and related
     documentation (e.g., LISP application programs or code that
     alters the operation of the Software) together with the Software,
     provided that each Additional File must be stored in a file
     separate from the Software, separately identified as required by
     Section 2.d below.

     YOU MAY NOT MODIFY OR OTHERWISE PREPARE DERIVATIVE WORKS OF THE
     SOFTWARE.

2. LIMITATIONS ON LICENSE. The license granted in Section 1 is subject

     other publicity) except solely as may be expressly authorized by
     this Agreement or by the prior written consent of Franz.

  f. Franz, in its sole and absolute discretion, may have included a
     portion of the source code or online documentation of the
