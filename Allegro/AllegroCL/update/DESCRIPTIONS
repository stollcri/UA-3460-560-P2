Patch File Descriptions

   This section lists the descriptions of the patch files available in
   this directory.  All patches publicly available as of the date on
   the top of this file are listed here.  The descriptions listed are
   admittedly cryptic and may not reveal all the problems that the
   patches fix.  Also not every "known" problem is fixable by a patch
   file.  Contact Franz Inc. (see below) if you have questions about
   patches or have a problem which seems not to be fixed by any of the
   patches in this directory.

   Gaps in the numbering do not necessarily indicate missing patches.

   If you have any questions about any patch or the patch loading
   procedure, please contact Franz Inc. by email at bugs@franz.com, by
   phone at (510) 452-2000 (during US Pacific time zone work hours), or
