<h1>Introduction to ORBLink</h1>

<hr>

<p>ORBLink is a CORBA Object Request Broker (ORB) for Allegro Common Lisp. ORBLink allows
a Lisp program to communicate with programs written in other languages, possibly running
on other machines. </p>

<p><strong>CORBA</strong> stands for Common Object Request Broker Architecture. CORBA is a
set of protocols that enable distributed applications, potentially running in multiple
languages, to communicate with one another. The CORBA specification is managed by the <strong>Object
Management Group</strong>, at <a href="http://www.omg.org">http://www.omg.org</a>, a
consortium of hundreds of industry, government, and academic institutions. Another good
set of links is available from <a href="http://www.cetus-links.org/cetus/oo_corba.html">Cetus</a>.
</p>

<p>CORBA data types are specified in a simple description language called <strong>IDL</strong>,
the Interface Description Language. </p>

<p>ORBLink provides functionality that converts IDL into native Lisp types, and that
allows a Lisp program to invoke operations on objects, possibly remote specified in IDL. </p>

<p>There are numerous books and <a href="corba-cover-story-1.htm#references">references</a>
on CORBA. In addition, <a href="corba-cover-story-1.htm">here</a> is another high-level,
non-technical overview of ORBLink based on a cover story on the Franz Inc. Web site. </p>

<p>Because CORBA applications typically involve multiple distributed components, they can
become somewhat complicated. Feel free to ask questions of <a href="mailto:bugs@franz.com">bugs@franz.com</a>
(despite its name, use that address for questions as well as bug reports). </p>
