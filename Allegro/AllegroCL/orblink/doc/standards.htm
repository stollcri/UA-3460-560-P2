    <h1>The IDL/Lisp Standard and ORBLink</h1>
<hr>
The CORBA IDL/LISP proposed standard mapping allows the implementor
flexibility in the implementation of various types and functions. The
purpose of this document is to describe the choices we have made.

<h2>Sequence handling</h2>

This ORB always unmarshals values corresponding to the IDL sequence
type as vectors. However, a list may be used anywhere a sequence is
expected.

<h2>float and double types</h2>

<code>corba:float</code>, 
corresponding to the IDL 
<code>float</code> type, denotes the type
<code>single-float</code>.
<p>
<code>corba:double</code>, corresponding to the IDL <code>double</code> type,
denotes the type 
<code>double-float</code>.
<p>
<h2>Operation mapping</h2>
<p>
ORBLink implements CORBA operations as generic functions. An operation
named "foo" will be mapped to a method on a standard generic function
named <code>OP:FOO</code>. 
<p>
The signature of the generic function is <code>(T &REST ARGS)</code>.
<p>
User code may rely on the fact that 
<code>OP:FOO</code>
is a funcallable object and
may freely use auxiliary methods with such objects. However, Franz may
change the low-level implementation of such functions in the future
and user code should not rely on the metaclass or the signature of
such generic functions.
<p>
<h2>Unimplemented features</h2>
The following aspects of the CORBA Core are unimplemented:
<ol>
<li>DII/DSI
<li><strike>Wide strings, wide characters</strike>
<i>[no longer true as of Orblink 2.2.03]</i>
<li>Extended numeric types (long double, long long)
<li>Fixed types
<li><strike>POA</strike>
<i>[no longer true]</i>
<li>Contexts
</ol>
<h2>Note on on enum types</h2>
According to the CORBA 2.2 specification, an enum type does not begin a new naming scope. This means that enum members themselves define
a new type in the namespace of the IDL construct containing the enum type definition. The CORBA 2.3 specification may change this counter-intuitive rule. In any case, we follow the CORBA 2.2 specification so that users must make sure that enum members do not conflict with names in a containing scope.
