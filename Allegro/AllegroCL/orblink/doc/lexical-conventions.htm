<h1>Lexical conventions</h1>

<hr>

<p>The ORBLink documentation necessarily involves simultaneous discussion of IDL datatypes
and their associated Lisp types. These types typically have names that are quite similar. </p>

<p>IDL is also case-sensitive, whereas ANSI Common Lisp is not. </p>

<p>Unfortunately it is the case that in the current version of this documentation there is
no standard font or case distinction that would allow the reader to distinguish lexically
the name of an IDL type from the name of the corresponding Lisp type. </p>

<p>In most cases the context should make the distinction clear. When it does not, please
contact <a href="mailto:bugs@franz.com">bugs@franz.com</a>. </p>
