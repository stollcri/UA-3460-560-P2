Common Stock Funds

Many individuals invest in common stock funds for their long-term growth 
potential. Nearly all common stock funds seek to provide long-term growth 
of capital as an investment objective. More conservative stock funds may 
include dividend income as a secondary consideration. In general, the higher 
the proportion of a fund's return that is derived from income, the less 
volatile its performance will be from one year to the next.
