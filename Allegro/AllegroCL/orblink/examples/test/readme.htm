This directory contains files for a simple Lisp-Lisp test.

To load the test, from this directory:

<pre>
(in-package :user)
(load "test-invoke.cl")
</pre>

To run the server:

<pre>
(test-server "filename")
</pre>

Where "filename" is the name of a file in which the IOR is to be stored.
<p>
To run the client:
<pre>
(test-client "filename")
</pre>

<p>
This will return a list of values that tests various features of the ORB. The IDL for this
example is located in the file <a href="test.idl">test.idl</a>.

This test can serve as a pedagogical example, as a number of ORB features are tested.
