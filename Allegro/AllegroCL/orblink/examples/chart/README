This is a simple chart demo.

This demo is not supported yet.

The hardest thing about this demo is compiling it, because it requires
the KLG JChart package, which can be downloaded from www.klg.com, as
well as the visiginic ORB.

The file chart.idl encapsulates the interface of a dataset and several charts.

The chart server can be started via 
 (load "cl/dataset-invoke.cl")
 (dataset-server)

To make the Java client, assuming that the JChart classes are in your classpath,
from java/visibroker the make all command should work.

Following this, 
 make run

will bring up a chart. 

Any number of chart clients can execute. A point can edited by dragging
it with the mouse. Clicking on the right mouse button on a chart
allows for customization of color and chart type.

Executing

(dataset-perturb dataset)

in the Lisp server will randomly modify the dataset values.
This will be reflected in all listeners.
