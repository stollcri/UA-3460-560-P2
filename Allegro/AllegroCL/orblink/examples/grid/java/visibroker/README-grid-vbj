This file contains sample code and invocation for starting a client or a server
using Visibroker for Java 3.1.

	The files:

	Makefile: compiles and runs the example.
	Client.java	Java client code
	Server.java	Java server code
	gridImpl.java	Implementation of the interface in the file ../../idl/grid.idl	

You must be using Visibroker for Java 3.2 or later.

The vbj and vbjc utilities in visibroker must be in your path. The
com.franz.orblink package must be accessible from your CLASSPATH (see
orblink java installation notes).

To compile the IDL: (create Java stubs and skeletons for the file
		../../idl/grid.idl)

	make idl

To compile the Java code
	make classes

To run the client: (Uses the SimpleNameServer to store the IOR of the implementation in a file)
	make run-client

To run the server: (publishes the IOR of the server to a file using SimpleNameServer)
	make run-server
