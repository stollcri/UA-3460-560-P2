This directory contains a simple common Lisp client and server
implementing the IDL code in ../idl/grid.idl.

The file grid-implementation.cl contains the actual implementation
code; it defines the class user::grid-implementation and the
implementations of the methods in the file grid.idl.

The file grid-invoke.cl contains functions that start a client or
server and invoke the client.  These functions are sufficiently simple
that they could be invoked interactively as well.

To run the system:

Start up a Lisp listener and load orblink.

Load the grid system:

:ld grid-invoke.cl ; You will have to give the full path of grid-system from the current working directory, or course

; Now to create a Lisp server and publish its IOR for any client, just execute

Choose a filename, say <filename>, that will be used to store the IOR of the grid server. 

To run the server execute

(grid-server <filename>)

; To run a grid-client, execute

(grid-client <filename>)

These functions are documented more carefully in cl/grid-invoke.cl.
