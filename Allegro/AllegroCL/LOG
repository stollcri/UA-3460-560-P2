ide patch pil004
Date Posted: Tue Dec 20 16:46:45 PST 2011
Patch names: update/pil004.001
Description: There is an unsolved bug where for some users on Windows
  7 the IDE can write to its options file a screen location for the
  main IDE window that's shifted completely off of the screen, and
  then the IDE is not seen at all when restarting it. This patch
  fixes things back up by forcing the main IDE window back onto the
  screen when it is restarted.

base patch net-xml-generator
Date Posted: Tue Dec 20 16:46:45 PST 2011
Patch names: code/net-xml-generator.001
Description: Any computed atribute value that evaluates to nil
  suppresses the entire atribute-value pair, rather than generating
  foo="NIL". All occurrences of the`>' char that the module sees are
  now escaped. This addresses a nonconformance when the CDATA-ending
  string "]]>" appears elsewhere, in element content or in an
  attribute value.

base-lisp patch pia015
Date Posted: Tue Dec 20 11:11:32 PST 2011
Patch names: update/pia015.001
Description: Previously, when a file was loaded with -L the first
  line was skipped if it started with ## for the sake of #! scripts
  (as in #!/bin/sh on unix). This fix disables this behavior, use -#!
  for this purpose.
Impact: recommended
Other info: Automated scripts may fail once this patch is installed,
  if it relies on the prior behavior. Please check for this.

smputil patch smputil
Date Posted: Mon Oct 10 10:53:01 PDT 2011
Patch names: cdoe/smputil.003
Description:
  This patch implements condition-variable functions for ACL
  8.2 based on the POSIX definition of condition variables. The
  new functions are:
  
  `make-condition-variable' (&key name)
  
  Create a condition-variable instance
  
  `condition-variable-signal' (condvar)
  
  Release exactly one process waiting on this
  condition-variable instance. Returns nil if none waiting.
  
  `condition-variable-broadcast' (condvar)
  
  Release all the processes waiting on this
  condition-variable instance. Returns nil if none waiting.
  
  `condition-variable-wait' (condvar lock &key timeout whostate)
  
  The lock should be owned by the calling process. The lock
  is released during the wait and re-acquired before returning 
  to the caller. Returns nil on timeout.
  
  Full descriptions will be added to the online documentation of
  the smputil module.
  
  The macro `with-sharable-lock' is also included in this
  patch to provide access to sharable locks with more control
  than `with-shared-lock' and `with-exclusive-lock' allow.

base patch inflate
Date Posted: Wed Sep 21 11:45:07 PDT 2011
Patch names: code/inflate.003
Description:
  A small overhaul to how headers and trailers are handled in
  inflate-streams. This patch makes the following changes to
  inflate-streams:
  
  Add a :compression argument to inflate-streams that roughly
  mirrors the same keyword argument in deflate-streams.
  Acceptable values are: 
  * :gzip - (default) Automatically read past gzip 
    header/trailer on stream before/after inflating data. 
  * :zlib - Automatically read past zlib header/trailer 
    on stream before/after inflating data. 
  * :deflate - compressed stream has no header/trailer, only
    DEFLATE blocks. 
  * (header-fn trailer-fn) - Instead of the built-in methods,
    users may specify their own functions for skipping past
    headers and trailers wrapping the DEFLATE stream. This can 
    be used to support less common encoding methods, such as
    zip or pkzip, etc. The inflate module does not capture any
    information from header and trailers, so the custom 
    functions can also be used to capture this information if
    needed. The function must accept a single argument, which is
    the input-handle of the inflate-stream. It should return nil
    or the number of bytes read. The header-fn will be called at
    device-open time before any DEFLATE blocks are read. The
    trailer-fn will be called immediately after the final 
    DEFLATE block is read. 
  * nil - This is equivalent to the :deflate option
  
  The :skip-gzip-header keyword argument to inflate-streams is 
  deprecated and will be quietly ignored. This is necessary to
  maintain backward compatibility with compression support in
  AllegroServe.
  
  The utility functions skip-gzip-trailer, skip-zlib-header, and
  skip-zlib-trailer are now exported from the :util.zip package.
  
Impact: recommended

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
base patch deflate
Date Posted: Wed Sep 21 11:45:07 PDT 2011
Patch names: code/deflate.003
Description:
  Clarifies and expands the :compression arguments acceptable 
  for deflate-streams.
  
  Before this patch, acceptable args were :gzip, which added
  gzip-style header and trailer to the compression stream, and
  :deflate, which somewhat confusingly added a zlib style header
  and trailer to the stream.
  
  With this patch, the arguments can now be :gzip or :zlib, 
  which will create a compressed stream with the appropriate
  headers and trailers added, or :deflate, which will add no
  headers.
  
Impact: recommended

base-lisp patch pia014
Date Posted: Thu Sep  8 12:55:13 PDT 2011
Patch names: update/pia014.001
Description: <patch-doc>
<p>The nesting behavior of #- not well defined.  This patch changes
  the
behavior of Allegro CL when *sharp-plus-de-facto-standard-compatible*

compiler patch pib009 for x86-64 only
Date Posted: Wed Aug 24 14:46:19 PDT 2011
Patch names: update/pib009.001
Description: Fixes a peephole optimizer bug in which a label which is
  called out in a jump-table case form is not properly forwarded when
  its target is itself a branch and the branch has been "tensioned".
  The situation is hard to reproduce, but the failure is a compaint
  by the assembler about nil not being an appropriate value for a
  numeric operation.

acache patch acache-2.1.17
Date Posted: Tue Aug 23 15:57:43 PDT 2011
Patch names: code/acache-2.1.17.fasl (version 2117)
Description: AllegroCache can now correctly close read-only
  databases, and can bind to an arbitrary internet or local address,
  by providing the :address keyword argument to start-server. To bind
  to a local (unix domain) socket, pass a path name object instead of
  an internet address.

smputil patch smputil
Date Posted: Wed Aug 10 14:40:44 PDT 2011
Patch names: code/smputil.002
Description:
  When a sharable-lock instance was used recursively in
  exclusive mode, an array index error was signalled. This patch
  avoids the error. The patch also corrects an error in
  make-sharable-lock; the max-shared argument now defaults to 20
  as stated in the documentation.
  
  The recursive-p argument to make-sharable-lock is extended and
  the locking functions and macros accept a :recursive-p
  keyword argument that overrides the specification in the lock.
  The argument may be t, nil or a list of the keywords
  :exclusive, :shared, :upgrade, and :downgrade. The value t is
  equivalent to (:exclusive, :shared). Read the updated on-line
  documentation for more details.

Date Posted: Thu May 19 19:20:08 PDT 2011
Patch names: code/jlinker.003, code/jlinkent.003, update/pin001.003
Description: Reverts to original jlinker module, as released with
  Allegro CL 8.2. Jlinker patches as published after the Allegro CL
  8.2 release introduced what were considered to be small API
  incompatibilities that unfortunately had the potential to cause
  problems for distributed client/server applications that made use
  of the module. As a result, we are reverting back to the original
  version and opting to delay the improved jlinker patch until our
  next software release.

cg9.0 patch * ...
Date Posted: Thu Apr 28 10:07:24 PDT 2011
Patch names: code90/*, update.sh, update.cl, require-search-list.txt
Description:
  This is a preview of the ACL 9.0 CG and IDE running on ACL 
  8.2. The main use is to test the new Unicode support. To use
  it, you must:
  
  
  * Rename require-search-list.txt to require-search-list.cl. 
  * Run update.exe (Windows) or update.sh (all other). This will
  rebuild your `allegro' and `allegro-ansi' images to use the 
  new CG/IDE.
  
  The Unicode support allows you to specify any lisp string
  (which is always two-byte Unicode in the 16-bit version of 
  ACL) as the value of any widget or menu-item or title-bar and
  so on, or when drawing on windows, and any characters that the
  font contains should be drawn correctly. This usually allows
  using Asian or European scripts without specifying a 
  particular font, and never requires rebooting Windows with a
  particular locale.
  
  There is also support in the IDE editor for saving files using
  either the default external format (such as Latin1), or UTF8,
  or two-byte Unicode. See the new options on the right side of
  the Editor tab of the `Tools | Options dialog'.
  
  This release also includes all of the other CG and IDE
  enhancements that have been made for the 9.0 release of ACL.
  
Impact: experimental-minimal
Other info: This patch requires specific changes by the user in order
  for the new CG to be used. This patch should otherwise be safe to
  download.

Date Posted: Tue Feb 15 17:40:00 PST 2011
Patch names: code/mysql.002
Description:
  Adds a :client-flags keyword argument to dbi.mysql:connect.
  
  This allows the user to request certain client behavior at
  connect time. The value of this keyword arg should be a
  logior'd set of one or more exported client flags. The
  following flags are exported from the dbi.mysql package for
  use:
  
  
  * `CLIENT_FOUND_ROWS': Return found instead of affected rows 
  * `CLIENT_NO_SCHEMA': Don't allow db.table.column syntax in
    queries 
  * `CLIENT_IGNORE_SPACE': Ignore whitespace between function
    name and '(' 
  * `CLIENT_INTERACTIVE': client is interactive. The server sets
    wait_timeout to interactive_timeout. The following flags are
  also supported, and are set by the mysql client by default:
  
  
  * `CLIENT_LONG_PASSWORD': client supports post MySQL 4.1
    password format 
  * `CLIENT_LONG_FLAG': client will get all column flags 
  * `CLIENT_CONNECT_WITH_DB': Can specify a database at connect
    time. 
  * `CLIENT_LOCAL_FILES': client can use LOAD DATA LOCAL 
  * `CLIENT_PROTOCOL_41': client speaks mysql 4.1 protocol 
  * `CLIENT_TRANSACTIONS': client knows about transactions 
  * `CLIENT_SECURE_CONNECTION': client supports 4.1
    authentication. Impact: minor

  manually download this patch, visit
  ftp://ftp.franz.com/pub/patches/8.2/. Change into the directory
  specific to your architecture and download the shared library files
  shown in the patch listing that are available. If running the
  Express Edition, only acli8218t.dll (.lib and .pdb) or
  libacli8218t.so are needed. The files should be saved into the root
  directory of your Allegro CL installation.

compiler patch pib006
Date Posted: Wed Oct 27 12:19:34 PDT 2010
Patch names: update/pib006.001
Description: Fixes bugs in both dolist and dotimes regarding the
  checking of type declarations; the
  comp:verify-type-declarations-switch has brought out incorrect
  assumptions in type declarations, some of which are built into our
  macroexpansions, and some of which are reasonable declarations on
  loop variables that a user might provide. For example, a dolist
  variable might reasonably be declared as a type simple-vector if
  all of the elements of the list are simple-vectors, but since the
  spec requires that the loop variable be bound to nil as the result
  form is run, the type-checking calls the binding out as an error.
  In dotimes, the loop variable is always non-negative, and the loop
  will never run if the termination value is negative, but there will
  be an error if type-checking is enabled. This patch fixes these
  unreasonable errors.

aserve patch aserve
Date Posted: Fri Jul  9 13:53:53 PDT 2010
Patch names: code/aserve.001
Description:
  The :keep-alive argument to do-http-request will now
  cause do-http-request to return a fifth value: a socket
  connected to the server. That fifth value will be nil if the
  server refuses to keep the connection with the client open.
  Even if the server agrees to keep the connection alive it will
  close it after some period of inactivity.
  
  do-http-request takes a :connection argument which is how the
  socket returned by do-http-request should be passed to the
  next do-http-request call. It is ok if the value of the
  :connection argument is nil or closed socket. do-http-request
  will notice that the socket is unusable and will create a new
  one.

base patch streamc ...
Date Posted: Tue May 18 15:48:39 PDT 2010
Patch names: code/streamc.002, update/pia005.001
Description: Fixes many inconsistencies between functions in
  streamd.fasl (always loaded into the lisp) and the streamc module,
  which is loaded either explicitly or when gray streams are
  required. Over the years, the fixes to streamd have not been
  matched to fixes in streamc, so some simple-streams bugs which were
  fixed will seem to reappear when streamc is loaded.  The
  streamc.002 patch reconciles these differences.  There is also one
  inconsistency where a fix in streamc was not reflected in streamd,
  and that is taken care of by the regular patch.
Impact: recommended
Other info: For users for whom the streamc module is never loaded
  (check the *modules* list) there should be no impact. For users of
  gray streams, there may be some places where the bad behaviors are
  expected; test your apps after loading this patch if you are close
  to a release.

compiler patch pib004
Date Posted: Thu Apr  8 11:12:26 PDT 2010
Patch names: update/pib004.001
Description: Fixes a problem on Sparc and AIX platforms where under
  high debug, generation of source level debug info is attempted, but
  the info is incomplete because the platforms have not yet had
  source debugging fully implemented. A warning will be given the
  first time high debug is seen per lisp session. An internal
  variable comp::*sparc-aix-warn* which starts with a true value may
  be set to nil to inhibit the warning from ever being generated.
Impact: minor
Other info: Recommended for sparc and aix users.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
aclrpc patch pim001
Date Posted: Wed Apr  7 14:08:48 PDT 2010
Patch names: update/pim001.001
Description: Under some circumstances, it was possible for an aclrpc
  process to remain hung in a write to a socket for which the
  destination no longer existed. This patch adds a :write-timeout
  argument to make-rpc-server and make-rpc-client. When a positive
  value is specified, write operations that take longer than that
  number of seconds are terminated with a timeout. The default is nil
  for compatibility with previous versions.
Impact: recommended

ide patch ide-project ...
Date Posted: Thu Apr  1 10:09:34 PDT 2010
Patch names: code/ide-project.001, update/pil003.001
Description: In the Express version of the IDE, a new warning dialog
  will appear at IDE startup time when it is near the time when the
  license needs to be renewed for uninterrupted use.
Impact: recommended

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ide patch pil002
Date Posted: Thu Apr  1 10:09:34 PDT 2010
Patch names: update/pil002.001
Description: When using Search | Complete Symbol in the IDE, it could
  break in certain cases when trying to complete a symbol from a
  child package, such as :dbi.mysql. In some cases, the Complete
  Symbol check would then try to check whether the symbol is exported
  from the parent package, e.g :dbi. If the module for that parent
  package is not available when an attempt is made to autoload it, an
  error could result.
Impact: recommended

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ide patch pil001 for gtk only
Date Posted: Thu Apr  1 10:09:34 PDT 2010
Patch names: update/pil001.001
Description: On GTK platforms (Linux and Mac OS X), if you do a
  string search in the IDE's editor and then immediately do a string
  replace on the same string, the first replace that's done will be
  the next match after the currently selected one, rather than the
  already selected one.
Impact: recommended

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cg patch cg-menu for mswindows only
Date Posted: Thu Apr  1 10:09:34 PDT 2010
Patch names: code/cg-menu.001
Description: On Windows, a child window that has a menu-bar would
  misposition widgets on tab-controls that are not on the initially
  selected tab.
Impact: recommended

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cg patch pik001 for gtk only
Date Posted: Thu Apr  1 10:09:34 PDT 2010
Patch names: update/pik001.001
Description: On the GTK platforms (Linux and Mac OS X), setting the
  pop-up property of a form window in a project to true led to the
  form window itself being recreated as a top-level window when
  re-opening the project. This made it difficult to edit the form
  window further in the IDE.
Impact: recommended

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
compiler patch pib003
Date Posted: Wed Mar 31 13:34:29 PDT 2010
Patch names: update/pib003.001
Description: Fixes an esoteric register allocation bug which leaves
  the compiler with "No from-creg to move ...", usually to an :iparam
  (input parameter) location. The fix also removes many "register
  reassigned to frame" warnings, which were caused by the same
  mismanagement of input parameters to a function.
Impact: recommended
Other info: Possible destabilization of the lisp. Full tests have
  been run, but avoid loading if close to a product release.
  Recompiling of affected code is necessary.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
base patch sock
Date Posted: Tue Mar 30 14:21:36 PDT 2010
Patch names: code/sock.001
Description: When peforming dns lookups in :clib mode via
  socket:lookup-hostname, the mechanism for caching lookups did not
  distinguish between A record and AAAA record requests. As a result,
  it would be possible to get an ipv4 address returned when
  requesting an ipv6 address. This patch corrects the problem.
Impact: recommended

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
eli patch fi-xemacs.el ...
Date Posted: Tue Mar 30 14:21:36 PDT 2010
Patch names: eli/fi-xemacs.el, xeli/fi-xemacs.elc
Description: Corrects an error when using
  fi:compile-changed-definitions in Xemacs version 21.4 or older. A
  function not fboundp error could be triggered due to
  replace-regexp-in-string not being defined.
Impact: recommended
Other info: Affects Xemacs only. You may need to run 'M-x
  byte-compile-file (<Allegro directory>/xeli/fi-xemacs.el)' from
  your Xemacs, and then restart it in order to apply this patch.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
agraph-3.3 patch pio007
Date Posted: Tue Mar 30 14:21:36 PDT 2010
Patch names: update/agraph/3.3/pio007.001
Description: A bug in the Sesame XML transaction document parser
  caused text to be partially reversed when XML entities were present
  ("A&amp;B" would become "B&A"). This is now fixed.
Impact: recommended

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
base patch update.fasl (version 2)
Date Posted: Thu Mar 18 12:42:56 PDT 2010
Patch names: code/update.fasl (version 2)
Description: On windows, file times are stored as local to the
  current time zone, potentially invalidating the cache of downloaded
  patches when changing time zones or crossing dst boundaries. This
  patch accounts for this possibility and prevents unnecessarily
  re-downloading patches that have already been fetched.
Impact: recommended

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
base-lisp patch pia002
Date Posted: Thu Mar 18 14:46:45 PDT 2010
Patch names: update/pia002.001
Description: Fixes typep to recognize a bit array also as one of type
  (*array (integer 0 1) *).
Impact: recommended

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
compiler patch pib002
Date Posted: Thu Mar 18 14:46:45 PDT 2010
Patch names: update/pib002.001
Description: Fixes a bug whereby a variable which has been set from
  another variable might under esoteric condition be thought to
  contain a constant value, even though the second variable is setq'd
  somewhere within its scope. This might especially happen if the
  second variable has been the subject of a predicate in a cond
  statement, e.g. `(let ((y x)) (cond ((null x) (if y ...))))'.  The
  initializing of y is not necessarily the only storing of y, but if
  x was initially a constant, the bug was that y might be thought of
  as having a constant type.
Impact: recommended
Other info: Possible regression: Recompilation is necessary, and
  recommended only when full testing can subsequently be done.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
base patch init2r for mswindows only
Date Posted: Tue Mar 16 10:40:55 PDT 2010
Patch names: code/init2r.001
Description: Previously, starting a Lisp application with double
  backslashes could, in some circumstances, cause an error on
  application startup. This is no longer a problem.
Impact: recommended

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
clim patch pij002
Date Posted: Mon Mar 15 15:58:06 PDT 2010
Patch names: update/pij002.001
Description: Space requirement computation for certain types of combo
  boxes would break with an error about a missing slot. Also,
  computation for list panes would complain about a similar problem
  if no items were specified. This patch fixes these errors.
Impact: recommended

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
clim patch pij001
Date Posted: Mon Mar 15 15:58:06 PDT 2010
Patch names: update/pij001.002
Description: This patch removes spurious warning messages about
  missing fallback font character sets from first-time CLIM
  application startup on X11 platforms. Some warnings in 8-bit lisps
  were missed by the previous version of this patch.
Impact: cosmetic

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
agraph-3.3 patch pio006
Date Posted: Mon Mar 15 15:58:06 PDT 2010
Patch names: update/agraph/3.3/pio006.001
Description: This change allows for SPARQL's idiom for
  Negation-As-Failure to be detected more reliably, and thus executed
  more optimally.
Impact: recommended

  the class of the type 'atom.
Impact: recommended

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
base-lisp patch pia001
Date Posted: Mon Mar 15 15:58:06 PDT 2010
Patch names: update/pia001.001
Description: Fixes issues with the attempt in the 8.2 CLOS walker to
  remove macrolet and symbol-macrolet definitions from the code it is
  walking. An internal variable called excl::*keep-macrolet* which
  defaults to true can be set to nil to get the removal behavior as
  in the pre-patched 8.2 lisp.
Impact: recommended

agraph-3.3 patch pio004
Date Posted: Fri Mar 12 10:32:31 PST 2010
Patch names: update/agraph/3.3/pio004.001
Description: AllegroGraph's SPARQL engine raises an error when
  imposed bindings (the :with-variables keyword argument to
  run-sparql) are not a subset of the variables mentioned in the body
  of the query. This error checking failed to include variables
  mentioned in a CONSTRUCT template or DESCRIBE variable list, which
  meant
that query invocations which imposed bindings for variables mentioned
  in the CONSTRUCT template alone would raise an error. This patch
  corrects the error checking behavior.
Impact: recommended

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
agraph-3.3 patch pio003
Date Posted: Fri Mar 12 10:32:31 PST 2010
Patch names: update/agraph/3.3/pio003.001
Description: AllegroGraph 3.3 new support for SPARQL UPDATE did not
  work correctly on RDFS++ triple-stores when it tries to add new
  triples. This patch corrects the bug so that SPARQL UPDATE works
  seamlessly on RDFS++ stores and regular triple-stores.
Impact: recommended

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
agraph-3.3 patch pio002
Date Posted: Fri Mar 12 10:32:31 PST 2010
Patch names: update/agraph/3.3/pio002.001
Description: This patch restores the behavior of print-triple to what
  it was in AllegroGraph 3.2. AllegroGraph 3.3 inadvertently changed
  print-triple so that it no longer returned the triple that it
  printed. This patch also documents this behavior for future
  reference.
Impact: recommended

  libacl8218.so, libacli8218.dylib, libacl8218.dylib
Description: Fixes two bugs, one fixing delete, delete-if, and
  delete-if-not when shrinking vectors, and also a bug where stack
  objects left over from a dumplisp call in the previous incarnation
  of the lisp are not properly cleaned up.
Impact: recommended
Other info: If your Express Edition lisp won't start due to running
  update.sh, some preliminary action is required. If
  allegro-expressorig.dxl exists, move it to allegro-express.dxl,
  start alisp, run sys:update-allegro, exit, and then run
  update.exe/update.sh
