   DESCRIPTIONS
    -- This information file.

   <name>.fasl
    -- (where <name> is patch name).  These are the actual patch
       files.  Descriptions of the individual patches are below.  You can
       take as many or as few of these patch files as you want or think
       you need.  These patch files should be installed in the
       uri subdirectory of your Allegro CL distribution
       directory (the directory into which the Allegro CL distribution
       tape or CD was read).

Patch File Descriptions

   This section lists the descriptions of the patch files available in
   this directory.  All patches publicly available as of the date on
   the top of this file are listed here.  The descriptions listed are
   admittedly cryptic and may not reveal all the problems that the
   patches fix.  Also not every "known" problem is fixable by a patch
   file.  Contact Franz Inc. (see below) if you have questions about
   patches or have a problem which seems not to be fixed by any of the
   patches in this directory.

   If you have any questions about any patch or the patch loading
   procedure, please contact Franz Inc. by email at bugs@franz.com, by
   phone at (510) 452-2000 (during US Pacific time zone work hours), or
