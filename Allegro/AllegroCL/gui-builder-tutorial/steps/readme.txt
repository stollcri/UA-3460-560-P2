This directory contains checkpoints for the Interface Builder
Tutorial.

Each subdirectory is labeled tutorial-chCsS, where C is the chapter
number and S is the step number within chapter C at which the files
were created.  Note that S may have leading zeroes ('0').

If, as you work through the tutorial, your files get into a confused
state, you can use a checkpoint directory to try getting back on track
without having to start the tutorial over from the beginning.  Copying
the files from tutorial-chCsS into your tutorial directory should
restore the state of the tutorial files to Chapter C, Step S.
