<h3>Doodler interface builder tutorial</h3>

<p>The steps are divided into Chapters, each a logical chunk of work. Steps are numbered.
Do the Chapters in sequential order; each one builds on the changes you make in the prior
Chapter(s). </p>

<h3>Notation</h3>

<p>A menu command is denoted <strong><em>Menu</em> | <em>Command</em></strong>, thus click
<strong>File | Save</strong> means click the <strong>Save</strong> command on the <strong>File</strong>
menu. We sometimes say <em>choose</em> <strong>File | Save</strong> instead of <em>click</em>
<strong>File | Save</strong>.</p>

<h3>A note on pathnames</h3>

<p>We use either forward slashes (/) or backward slashes (\) to identify directories in
pathnames (so <em>tutorial/steps/readme.txt</em> or <em>tutorial\steps\readme.txt</em>).
Backward slashes are standard in Windows but Allegro CL accepts either forward or backward
slashes.</p>

<h3>Using ToolTips</h3>

<p><img src="doc/d-1.jpg" width="360" height="87" alt="d-1.bmp (94014 bytes)"></p>

<p>In the early Chapters of the tutorial you'll see many illustrations for Allegro CL
controls, toolbars, and menus. They are meant to help familiarize you with everything in
the interface and will begin to diminish in number as you push further into the tutorial
material. This leaves you to rely on your memory and the ToolTips. ToolTips are the tiny
pop-ups you see whenever you pause your mouse over a button or another feature having
'what's this?' functionality. </p>

<p>The first time you move your mouse over a button the ToolTip will take a second to
display; if you then move your mouse to another button, the ToolTip appears immediately.</p>

<h3>Saving files</h3>

<p>We instruct you to save files at appropriate places as you work through the tutorial.
However, certain actions, such as running a form or project (by choosing <strong>Run | Run
Project</strong> or <strong>Run | Run Form</strong> or clicking on the <strong>Run</strong>
button), causes the system to prompt you to save project files if necessary. You can
either save files at that point or not. Saving when instructed is sufficient but
additional saves are harmless. </p>

<h3>Entering code</h3>

<p>Running the tutorial is easier if you copy and paste rather than enter all of the code
yourself. You can select and copy code from this document to the editor buffers in Allegro
CL in the usual Windows way. 

<ol>
  <li>Select the code in this document.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Edit | Copy</strong> (or Control-c) and go to Allegro CL. </li>
  <li>Give focus to the desired editor buffer with the cursor at the desired location.</li>
  <li>Click <strong>Edit | Paste</strong> (or Control-v).</li>
</ol>

<p>When you paste code in an editor buffer, extra spaces or blank lines may appear. They
can be ignored. Only be concerned if a break appears within a word rather than at a space
or a carriage return.</p>

<h3>Getting Help: if you are stuck</h3>

<p>Some of the Chapters in the Tutorial are long. You may find that you&#146;ve either
lost your place or missed a step if you had to save your work and are resuming it later
on. Figuring out which step you&#146;ve missed can be time-consuming and frustrating.
We&#146;ve provided a time-saving device for you.</p>

<p>There is a set of directories of code files created at points (checkpoints) in the
tutorial where you are most likely to encounter a problem. If you are stuck and would like
to copy the code for that checkpoint and move on to the next step, these directories will
help you.</p>

<p>Read the <em><strong>tutorial/steps/readme.txt</strong></em> file. It gives an
explanation of how the check-pointed files were created. Subdirectories containing code
files are numbered according to a <em>tutorial-chxx-sxxx</em> convention, where <em>chxx</em>
is the Chapter and <em>sxxx</em> is the Step. You should be able to copy the files from
that directory into your tutorial directory and then to move on from that point in the
tutorial.</p>

<p>For example, if you are stuck in Chapter 2, Step 10, then you are looking for the <em><strong>tutorial/steps/tutorial-ch2s010</strong></em>
directory. All the files you need to move on from Chapter 2, step 10 will be there. If you
are stuck on an intermediate step for which there is no directory, look for the most
recent check-pointed step you&#146;ve passed and copy those files. You can move on from
that point.</p>

<p>Adding files to the Project Manager is covered in Chapter 1.</p>

<p>Online help (in HTML format) is available for every function, variable, system dialog,
class, etc. Typically, pressing the F1 key while in a Lisp window displays online help for
the currently selected object. Also, see the file <em><strong>doc/cgide.htm</strong></em>,
which provides general information on CG/IDE documentation and essays on particular
topics.</p>

<p>This is a list of books on Lisp at the end of <a href="doc/doodler-ch6.htm">Chapter 6</a>.
An introduction to CLOS (the Common Lisp Object System) from ANSI Common Lisp by Paul
Graham is <a href="doc/ansi-common-lisp-on-clos.htm">here</a>. Links to all chapters and
to the introduction to CLOS from Paul Graham's <em>ANSI Common Lisp</em> book are in the
header and footer of each HTML file.</p>
