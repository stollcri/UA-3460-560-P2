				<h3>Rules</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>14 players required to be on roster</li>
					<li>You get all of a team's quarterbacks and kickers 
					(ex. CLE Ks or CLE QBs)</li>
					<li>Must start 1 QB, 2 RB, 3 WR, 1 K each week. 
					Players must be called in by name before their game starts and 
					full lineup must be in before 1pm on Sundays. 
					Lineups not called in on time will be the same as the previous week.</li>
					<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">FREE AGENTS:</span> The waiver wire 
					will be open Tuesday and Wednesday until 9pm. 
					If more than one team wants the same free agent, the team with the 
					worst record/lowest point total will get the player. A team can 
					only cut another team for 1 free agent per week 
					(multiple players can be acquired, but you can only cut for one).  
					Transactions can still be made after the wire closes and 
					the first to call gets the player. No transactions can be 
					made after the regular season ends (Week 14). 
					Transactions have a $5 fee.</li>
					<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">TRADES:</span> The trade deadline 
					is the start of Week 11. 
					Teams involved in trades must be in contention to make the playoffs. 
					Trades can be made at any time before the deadline. 
					Trades have no fees. One team cannot pay another to trade.</li>
					<li>Teams will be split into two divisions (picks 1-5 and picks 6-10). 
					The top two teams from each division make the playoffs. 
					Playoff teams will be seeded 1-4 based on their records and 
					matched 1 vs. 4 and 2 vs. 3. The winners play for the championship.</li>
					<li>There will be 14 regular season games. Playoffs will 
					be Week 15 and the SuperBowl will be Week 16.</li>
					<li><span style="font-weight: bold;">PAYOUTS:</span> 
					Division winners get $175. The other 
					two playoff teams get $125. The teams that make it to 
					the SuperBowl can agree to split the remaining 
					money ($400 + all transaction fees) however they want 
					<span style="font-weight: bold;">OR</span> the loser gets $75 and the winner gets 
					the rest ($325 + all transaction fees).</li>
