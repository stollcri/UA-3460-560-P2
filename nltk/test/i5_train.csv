Assign to Kam Myers ,"I think I have figured this out. Transport went to production around June This switched the valuation class of period work schedule ndx from to This setting will generate shift premium. In late January transport went to production which flipped the valuation class back to Because this change is not effective dated to a reasonable date, any time anyone who is on shifts CH ND or FM ND is retro ed back to then the shift premiums will be recalculated at and the money recovered. I am attaching a list of employees who are all on the above mentioned shifts. I would like to suggest that someone contact these people and give them the option of either having a forced retro done to recoup the money or set infotype so that retro will not occur and put them on a repayment plan for money paid during the period they were incorrectly paid. I copied another ee back to QAS ee and ran a simulation on time evaluation and it is indeed clawing back. A lot of these people have not had retro happen in a while, but once it does happen, you will have the same situation as ee If you have any questions, let me know. Sheila I'm copying you on an email where Harry wants to look into this. I ran a logged changes report and saw that on somebody probably the time manager went in and viewed some absences from as early as didn't make any changes, then saved the absences again. This caused a retro during the next payroll run. I know Sashi had worked on several issues relating to shift premiums, but I don't know what was fixed and what wasn't. There appear to be changes to the shift premiums that went back in history, that caused this problem the problem is, if other employees are in the same situation, they will also have their pay taken back retroactively! By the way, I have already copied this employee to HQ so that he she can be reviewed in the quality system instead of production. "

I think there is some issue with the forms still, unfortunately. What can I do to help? Kam Kam Myers RE COBRA Issue so much for your help Chris. Kam has to test these changes, she will be back on Monday, she is on vacation I wonder who approved that. Btw I know I said that we would get an ABAPer for the MX project but have you had a chance to look into the requirements? I was wondering if there is anything you would like to do. SvenOve Schreck RE COBRA Issue I have merged the SAP changes in with the Schaeffler customizations. I m not sure how to test it, so I m only hoping it works better now. CHris RE COBRA Issue Hey Chris, so much for your quick investigation. Let s just go ahead with the merging from standard includes to the Schaeffler specific includes. Since the process is currently broken anyways, no additional harm would be done. Regarding the C Kam said that it refers to some kind of form which we do not use. So the lines in which the C are being addressed should actually be commented out. How much effort do you think this would take from your side? again for your help. SvenOve Schreck RE COBRA Issue The issues seem to be in SGD HR PAUS COBF and SGD HR PAUS COBF There are many differences between these two files and the respective originals, but I do not see any conflicts where a specific line in each file differs. So, merging the changes should be straight forward. However, if the Schaeffler changes just do not work under EHP, then that would present another issue. I did find two sections of code in COBF that make reference to C, and that could simply be added to the Schaeffler version, but I would be a little surprised if that just worked. Since I am not familiar with this code, I am not sure which approach is desirable. We could start by adding the C code and continue adding code from the SAP standard until it runs, but there is no guarantee the merged files would work. COBRA Issue The COBRA process is run in three separate steps. The first step collects the events RPUCOB. This step is a standard SAP report, and still works as it should. The second step letter generation has been customized. The original report was RPUCOB, but David Oh copied the report to SGD HR PAUS RPUCOB so that he could add some ADP requirements. Over the past three years, the original RPUCOB has been updated through SAP support packages, but the custom report has only had some minor modifications documented in the report. After the EHP upgrade, the custom report is nonfunctional a runtime error occurs when trying to generate the report. My thought was to get the original report up and running so that it would be modified with the SAP support packages going forward. I tried this, but RPUCOB will not run successfully, due to the fact that it is looking for a form C . We do not have a form C, and I do not know how to create it. I have put some information in the ticket It might be as simple as creating the form, but I m just not sure. I hope this gave enough information let me know if more is needed! Kam "

This printer exists on USAVSS on both hp and hp. ","Hello John Robert, any Label printer we use in VSS is of type dpi. Zebra printfile, created via easy label also calculates with dots to be printed. That means that every printout on a dpi printer is half the size bigger as it should be. In former times we had a simular problem to print out labels from continetal, because they use only dpi printers. So if they try to print out on a vss production printer, labellayout was half the size too small. I do not have any idea which could helps you. They print out now over a special dpi printer in production in IWL. You are correct. However, I spoke with a Zebra representative, and he stated that whatever configuration the driver had will be the configuration used. What that means is even if I chang the print width on the printer device locally, if it is different than what is referenced in the driver, the value in the driver will override my change. I set up a print driver for Windows for this printer on my local computer, and changed the print width on that driver. This will allow me to print the correct width from Windows, but now I need to print the correct width from VSS by having someone update the print width reference on the driver that VSS uses. Is this something that you can help me with? In the Printerconfiguration site at Druckerkonfiguration anzeigen I see TRANSMISSIVE SENSOR SELECT THERMALTRANS.

Unfortunately, Ryder could not receive these in due to a lack of an ASN. We treated these as a return and rework, but due to the hand carrier could not get a new ASN yesterday. Below are the NCCA details for the order and I will work with Ronelle in Fort Mill to release a new ASN this morning. However, I wanted to let you know that there are physically pieces at Ryder. They were delivered last night to Brian Johnson of Ryder. He said to contact Rob Winstead or Nathan Droste of Quality Control or Tom Carsten of Inventory Management to get these parts. I will advise once an ASN is released. Brian T. Kreifels Schaeffler Sales Engineer NE Venture Dr Waukee, Iowa com ",This was resent

The MES system does not appear to be updating EP as quicklyl as anticipated. There is nothing that this group can do about that issue. The other issue, however, appears to deal with how the system determines who should get the back to green emails. When presented with a workstation that changed its status to production', it would find the last event that was of type production', setup', or other downtime'. The back to green mail was sent to all user's that had been notified by the system between these two events. However, the stamping presses frequently cycle from a repair state to a setup state and then to production. In this situation, the software would not send any notifications since its last good state was the setup that preceeded the return to production. The system has been modified to only consider production as a valid previous state. With this change, all personnel that were notified of an issue between the current event and the previous production event will be notified that the workstation is back in production. "

In my case, I manage the calendars for Jeff Hemphill and Matt Frary. Jeff and I are using Outlook but we don t have the new Windows installed. When Matt upgraded his operating system, some functions were lost. I can create meetings on his behalf but do not receive emails with invitations. The setup on his Outlook still looks unchanged. There are also problems when scheduling with his blackberry.

Want to follow up with user on this tomorrow when he has more time. Since changing to Window and Office it takes significantly longer to work with files in Buehl from Wooster. For Example I am using an Excel sheet, with Windows XP I can right click in a cell and nearly instantly get the appropriate menu. With Win Office when I right click in a cell it take seconds just to bring up the menu. Similar for creating folders. Win XP creates folders very quickly, there is a long delay with Win just to create a folder or rename it. This is really exagerated when I am on site at a customer trying to do it with a wireless card. Is something set wrong on my computer causing these delays? I can't imagine an upgrade should make thing this much worse. It takes really significantly longer to do the same work with Win and Office than with WinXP and Office Greg ","The folder path is too long, office running out of memory trying to read a file with a long name long folder path.

I saved a ppt that resides in Germany and timed it on the network hub and directly plugged in. The times were nearly identical. Today it saved directly in and thru the network hub in This is significantly improved from the day I wrote the help desk ticket. On that day I was saving a slide ppt and it was taking over minutes. The day I wrote the ticket my network speed for copying files was running something like kBb sec, this morning I was running at just over Mb sec. I just tried again and the network speed was around kB sec. The frustrating part is the old XP computer works MUCH faster than the new computer. It is going thru the same network hub Greg User is complaining about the network speed with his Windows Office laptop. It is taking longer to copy data and open and save files. Most of his work is done in Germany and the wait time has increased since his upgrades. When using his toughbook XP Office on the same connecction the time is much faster. His laptop is plugged into a netgear hub along with other devices. I suspect that this is the cause of his network problems. Can you check his network connection? Is he in a hub? Also try moving him to another port in the switch or another switch. Called Gregory, logged onto his pc,he was showing the files and folders where he had to access and the times it was taking to open them. Told me that on the other computer he had better network speed, that this one ony shows kb s. Line was breaking up, was kicked out of the phone, tried to call him back,he told me that needs to have the Laptop checked up, the network speed is not the best, needs to get it checked up and check the network and wireless drivers and settings on it. Check what could be wrong with the access and network I am having problems with network access times and saving files on Buehl servers with my new Win Office machine. As an example I did a SaveAs on a slide ppt presentation in both my Win Office machine as well as on my older testing Toughbook Win XP Office On my new Win Office machine it took min seconds to save. On the Win XP Office it took seconds. Earlier this morning I needed a file from Germany and copied it locally. After starting the copy to the desktop on the new Win machine, I navigated to the folder and started copying the same file on the Toughbook to the desktop. Even with a significant head start for the Win machine, the Toughbook XP finished min seconds sooner than the Win machine. It seems something is wrong with the network access on the new machine. Greg Heeke ",Checked with network and software groups. There is no way they are aware of to improve the speed for the data transfers and the file open and saves with Windows and Office

When using Autocad it DOES NOT allow me to open plant layout drawings at one time. This is a constant problem that takes away from the Users efficiency. I don't know if it is due to inadequate hardware or another reason. ,The AutoCAD hardware requirements should be the same as for ProE. A business laptop running Win with GB of RAM is not sufficient. consider upgrading the hardware.

Connected to Mr. Strong's PC and ran the Printer Reset application from NetInstall to clear and reload print drivers but no change. NetInstall opened slower than expected, printing works but it takes a few minutes for a simple print job to reach the server from Mr. Strong's PC, and he asked if overall network performance was getting slower because he's been noticing delays in other network activities. Pinged the printer and the print server from and the responses seemed somewhat normal most response times were <ms or ms but when I pinged from my PC, I noticed that the response times were slower than expected ranged from <ms to ms. change to a different network port and see if this improves the performance.
