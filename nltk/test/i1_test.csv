Alongside, I have asked Shannon to evaluate gaps in the value stream between Stratford and Joplin Shannon almost immediately became frustrated with the duplicated effort for the printing differences between the Joplin set up versus the Stratford setup. We met with Catherine Plum, the purchasing buyer who sets up the scheduling agreement, to see if there was something unique that she does versus the client buyer Teresa Harrison. There is nothing she does to create these input. So that drives the investigation to SAP setting differences that Stratford must have developed over the years to reduce manual input. The attached highlighted input are empty on a Joplin Scheduling agreement, but the input is there when Catherine Plum creates a scheduling agreement. Can you investigate what it is that is coded into the system when Catherine enters a scheduling agreement that does not happen when Teresa Harrison enters a scheduling agreement that automatically populates the scheduling agreement print output. The exact expectation is that when anyone in purchasing enters a scheduling agreement across North America, the print output should be automatically in place and not manually entered by the inventory planner.

Changed the printer definitions on the buyer configuratuions and the output determination worked as expected. Ticket will be closed.

Ms. Melaragno contacted Gerhard Schnell and the only change made to restore functionality was to open the Java control panel and enable the version again. It appears that the underlying cause of this problem was that the JRE updates that were installed on were not installed properly which resulted in the errors. When initially checking the PC, the Java control panel did not exist which is what prompted the reinstallation of After the reinstallation, Ms. Melaragno went through the Siemens client prep steps again and this should have corrected the problem if the initial step of disabling the current version wasn't done.

In week th June th June Patchlevel for SAP GUI Release is expected to be shipped. I will install Patchlevel on a test workstation. When there exist no problems with this patch, my colleagues from department will deploy the patch global via NetInstall. Kind Hergard Fischer Technical People Integration Earlier this year you requested for us to manually install patch level for the clients that noticed the calendar issue but as you can see from Mr. Fischer, there is a problem that was detected with patch level which is why we will only install the approved global installation so they are testing with patch level at the moment. I am but there is no actions that the CLIENT DEVELOPMENT R NA group can take with this request. You have already contacted Mr. Zuch to check the status of this and if no response is received, I would suggest contacting Mr. Fischer regarding the status of patch level Good morning. In SAP HP my calendar showsis a Saturday, but in the view it shows it rightis a Friday. I will attach a picture. advise.

SvenOve SchreckHi DE colleagues, it is my understanding that you are working on deploying the latest SAP GUI Patch Level so this ticket issue can get resolved.

But when multiple documents are being worked on at the same time it causes the laptop to freeze up and crash. check the size of the files he is using and what error he is getting when trying to open multiples.

Still had the same problem. I logged into my username and tried to print but had the same problem. Rob rolled the driver back for the printer and the problem seemed to go away. Scott was in a meeting and couldn't test under his username. I sent him an email to have him check and give me the results. Moved the port this computer was plugged into to a different port on another switch. I also used a new cable. I deleted and readded the printer v. Tried printing from notepad, wordpad, and outlook to this printer and still got the error. We tried printing to another lexmark v and was able to print with no problem or error message. Connected to Mr. Strong's PC and ran the Printer Reset application from NetInstall to clear and reload print drivers but no change. NetInstall opened slower than expected, printing works but it takes a few minutes for a simple print job to reach the server from Mr. Strong's PC, and he asked if overall network performance was getting slower because he's been noticing delays in other network activities. Pinged the printer and the print server from and the responses seemed somewhat normal most response times were <ms or ms but when I pinged from my PC, I noticed that the response times were slower than expected ranged from <ms to ms. change to a different network port and see if this improves the performance. ",Rolled the printer driver back to the previous version and the computer is now able to print again sucessfully.
