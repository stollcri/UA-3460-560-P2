Alongside, I have asked Shannon to evaluate gaps in the value stream between Stratford and Joplin Shannon almost immediately became frustrated with the duplicated effort for the printing differences between the Joplin set up versus the Stratford setup. We met with Catherine Plum, the purchasing buyer who sets up the scheduling agreement, to see if there was something unique that she does versus the client buyer Teresa Harrison. There is nothing she does to create these input. So that drives the investigation to SAP setting differences that Stratford must have developed over the years to reduce manual input. The attached highlighted input are empty on a Joplin Scheduling agreement, but the input is there when Catherine Plum creates a scheduling agreement. Can you investigate what it is that is coded into the system when Catherine enters a scheduling agreement that does not happen when Teresa Harrison enters a scheduling agreement that automatically populates the scheduling agreement print output. The exact expectation is that when anyone in purchasing enters a scheduling agreement across North America, the print output should be automatically in place and not manually entered by the inventory planner.

Could you look into increasing the allocated tmp space on the nodes? Each of the compute nodes has GB of disk space and I don t think it is using much of this. Looking at a few nodes, very little space is allocated to so tmp has a small amount of space. If we could allocate GB to tmp on all the child nodes, we could try this out to see if it works OK.

Jim says this is wrong and would like more RAM. User called back asking for an update. He has to open up multiple layouts and work with them all simultaneously. Doing this causes the program to crash. I agree with Doug that the hardware is insufficient to run the program in the manner that they are using it. If he was just working on one document I don't think the user notices. But when multiple documents are being worked on at the same time it causes the laptop to freeze up and crash. check the size of the files he is using and what error he is getting when trying to open multiples. When using Autocad it DOES NOT allow me to open plant layout drawings at one time. This is a constant problem that takes away from the Users efficiency. I don't know if it is due to inadequate hardware or another reason. ,The AutoCAD hardware requirements should be the same as for ProE. A business laptop running Win with GB of RAM is not sufficient. consider upgrading the hardware.
