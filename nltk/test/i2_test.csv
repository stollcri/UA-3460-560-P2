I saved a ppt that resides in Germany and timed it on the network hub and directly plugged in. The times were nearly identical. Today it saved directly in and thru the network hub in This is significantly improved from the day I wrote the help desk ticket. On that day I was saving a slide ppt and it was taking over minutes. The day I wrote the ticket my network speed for copying files was running something like kBb sec, this morning I was running at just over Mb sec. I just tried again and the network speed was around kB sec. The frustrating part is the old XP computer works MUCH faster than the new computer. It is going thru the same network hub Greg User is complaining about the network speed with his Windows Office laptop. It is taking longer to copy data and open and save files. Most of his work is done in Germany and the wait time has increased since his upgrades. When using his toughbook XP Office on the same connecction the time is much faster. His laptop is plugged into a netgear hub along with other devices. I suspect that this is the cause of his network problems. Can you check his network connection? Is he in a hub? Also try moving him to another port in the switch or another switch. Called Gregory, logged onto his pc,he was showing the files and folders where he had to access and the times it was taking to open them. Told me that on the other computer he had better network speed, that this one ony shows kb s. Line was breaking up, was kicked out of the phone, tried to call him back,he told me that needs to have the Laptop checked up, the network speed is not the best, needs to get it checked up and check the network and wireless drivers and settings on it. Check what could be wrong with the access and network I am having problems with network access times and saving files on Buehl servers with my new Win Office machine. As an example I did a SaveAs on a slide ppt presentation in both my Win Office machine as well as on my older testing Toughbook Win XP Office On my new Win Office machine it took min seconds to save. On the Win XP Office it took seconds. Earlier this morning I needed a file from Germany and copied it locally. After starting the copy to the desktop on the new Win machine, I navigated to the folder and started copying the same file on the Toughbook to the desktop. Even with a significant head start for the Win machine, the Toughbook XP finished min seconds sooner than the Win machine. It seems something is wrong with the network access on the new machine. Greg Heeke ",Checked with network and software groups. There is no way they are aware of to improve the speed for the data transfers and the file open and saves with Windows and Office
