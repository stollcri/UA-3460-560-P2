Assign to Kam Myers ,"I think I have figured this out. Transport went to production around June This switched the valuation class of period work schedule ndx from to This setting will generate shift premium. In late January transport went to production which flipped the valuation class back to Because this change is not effective dated to a reasonable date, any time anyone who is on shifts CH ND or FM ND is retro ed back to then the shift premiums will be recalculated at and the money recovered. I am attaching a list of employees who are all on the above mentioned shifts. I would like to suggest that someone contact these people and give them the option of either having a forced retro done to recoup the money or set infotype so that retro will not occur and put them on a repayment plan for money paid during the period they were incorrectly paid. I copied another ee back to QAS ee and ran a simulation on time evaluation and it is indeed clawing back. A lot of these people have not had retro happen in a while, but once it does happen, you will have the same situation as ee If you have any questions, let me know. Sheila I'm copying you on an email where Harry wants to look into this. I ran a logged changes report and saw that on somebody probably the time manager went in and viewed some absences from as early as didn't make any changes, then saved the absences again. This caused a retro during the next payroll run. I know Sashi had worked on several issues relating to shift premiums, but I don't know what was fixed and what wasn't. There appear to be changes to the shift premiums that went back in history, that caused this problem the problem is, if other employees are in the same situation, they will also have their pay taken back retroactively! By the way, I have already copied this employee to HQ so that he she can be reviewed in the quality system instead of production. "

They keep getting a message, Shipment in this state cannot be collected ","VSS user treiblri changed the Delivery Terms of shipment number from to onEDT. This caused shipment number to be in a state that the ship center could not close it properly, nor the corresponding load list. In order to resolve the issue, the German VSS team had to update the Delivery Terms for shipment number on the database, which will allow the shipment to be closed and allow the ship center to close the load list. I contacted Gary Knox at the ship center to communicate that load list number is ready to be closed in VSS. "

How about you? I am sorry to tell you that there is no decision so far. We decided that every requirement initially needs an Ticket Incident to get a decision. If the requirement is accepted, the next step will be to fill out the RFCdocument to get an effortestimation and a timeline about the next steps of implementation. Furthermore, we announced at the NOCPMO that the list with all requirements including the current status is available at the Intranet via this link the way how we handle all requirements regarding PW. So the first step for you to get a decision is to open a Ticket about your Request for Change. and BR, Andreas Wolf Zentrales Projektmanagement Support Tel.
