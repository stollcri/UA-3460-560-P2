Assign to Kam Myers ,"I think I have figured this out. Transport went to production around June This switched the valuation class of period work schedule ndx from to This setting will generate shift premium. In late January transport went to production which flipped the valuation class back to Because this change is not effective dated to a reasonable date, any time anyone who is on shifts CH ND or FM ND is retro ed back to then the shift premiums will be recalculated at and the money recovered. I am attaching a list of employees who are all on the above mentioned shifts. I would like to suggest that someone contact these people and give them the option of either having a forced retro done to recoup the money or set infotype so that retro will not occur and put them on a repayment plan for money paid during the period they were incorrectly paid. I copied another ee back to QAS ee and ran a simulation on time evaluation and it is indeed clawing back. A lot of these people have not had retro happen in a while, but once it does happen, you will have the same situation as ee If you have any questions, let me know. Sheila I'm copying you on an email where Harry wants to look into this. I ran a logged changes report and saw that on somebody probably the time manager went in and viewed some absences from as early as didn't make any changes, then saved the absences again. This caused a retro during the next payroll run. I know Sashi had worked on several issues relating to shift premiums, but I don't know what was fixed and what wasn't. There appear to be changes to the shift premiums that went back in history, that caused this problem the problem is, if other employees are in the same situation, they will also have their pay taken back retroactively! By the way, I have already copied this employee to HQ so that he she can be reviewed in the quality system instead of production. "

I think that it is empty, so I m not sure if that will resolve the error. Chris RE COBRA Issue I am trying to test the COBRA changes and I have run into this issue This is one of the errors that I was running into as well. I think there is some issue with the forms still, unfortunately. What can I do to help? Kam Kam Myers RE COBRA Issue so much for your help Chris. Kam has to test these changes, she will be back on Monday, she is on vacation I wonder who approved that. Btw I know I said that we would get an ABAPer for the MX project but have you had a chance to look into the requirements? I was wondering if there is anything you would like to do. SvenOve Schreck RE COBRA Issue I have merged the SAP changes in with the Schaeffler customizations. I m not sure how to test it, so I m only hoping it works better now. CHris RE COBRA Issue Hey Chris, so much for your quick investigation. Let s just go ahead with the merging from standard includes to the Schaeffler specific includes. Since the process is currently broken anyways, no additional harm would be done. Regarding the C Kam said that it refers to some kind of form which we do not use. So the lines in which the C are being addressed should actually be commented out. How much effort do you think this would take from your side? again for your help. SvenOve Schreck RE COBRA Issue The issues seem to be in SGD HR PAUS COBF and SGD HR PAUS COBF There are many differences between these two files and the respective originals, but I do not see any conflicts where a specific line in each file differs. So, merging the changes should be straight forward. However, if the Schaeffler changes just do not work under EHP, then that would present another issue. I did find two sections of code in COBF that make reference to C, and that could simply be added to the Schaeffler version, but I would be a little surprised if that just worked. Since I am not familiar with this code, I am not sure which approach is desirable. We could start by adding the C code and continue adding code from the SAP standard until it runs, but there is no guarantee the merged files would work. COBRA Issue The COBRA process is run in three separate steps. The first step collects the events RPUCOB. This step is a standard SAP report, and still works as it should. The second step letter generation has been customized. The original report was RPUCOB, but David Oh copied the report to SGD HR PAUS RPUCOB so that he could add some ADP requirements. Over the past three years, the original RPUCOB has been updated through SAP support packages, but the custom report has only had some minor modifications documented in the report. After the EHP upgrade, the custom report is nonfunctional a runtime error occurs when trying to generate the report. My thought was to get the original report up and running so that it would be modified with the SAP support packages going forward. I tried this, but RPUCOB will not run successfully, due to the fact that it is looking for a form C . We do not have a form C, and I do not know how to create it. I have put some information in the ticket It might be as simple as creating the form, but I m just not sure. I hope this gave enough information let me know if more is needed! Kam "

This printer exists on USAVSS on both hp and hp. ","Hello John Robert, any Label printer we use in VSS is of type dpi. Zebra printfile, created via easy label also calculates with dots to be printed. That means that every printout on a dpi printer is half the size bigger as it should be. In former times we had a simular problem to print out labels from continetal, because they use only dpi printers. So if they try to print out on a vss production printer, labellayout was half the size too small. I do not have any idea which could helps you. They print out now over a special dpi printer in production in IWL. You are correct. However, I spoke with a Zebra representative, and he stated that whatever configuration the driver had will be the configuration used. What that means is even if I chang the print width on the printer device locally, if it is different than what is referenced in the driver, the value in the driver will override my change. I set up a print driver for Windows for this printer on my local computer, and changed the print width on that driver. This will allow me to print the correct width from Windows, but now I need to print the correct width from VSS by having someone update the print width reference on the driver that VSS uses. Is this something that you can help me with? In the Printerconfiguration site at Druckerkonfiguration anzeigen I see TRANSMISSIVE SENSOR SELECT THERMALTRANS. PRINT METHOD PRINT WIDTH LABEL LENGTH IN MM MAXIMUM LENGTH I guess it's because your Printer ZTC ZMdpi ZPL See Haedline of site has only a printhead with dpi. "

Yolanda ,email to Jessica Hargett Shaun Kelly and Yolanda McCutcheon. Would you verify HP information for Mark Odgen and Gregory Peacock. Both users are assigned to same position number and both are valid to same position as of yesterday meaning they can see exact same info in SAP and probably portal.

The purpose of this email is to provide the latest information regarding the change so that we can make the implementation as smooth as possible and with minimum disruption. New Schedule Schaeffler Group will halt all inbound EDI processing June at noon eastern time. Schaeffler Group will continue processing outbound EDI to you based on inbound received prior to June at noon until approximately midnight eastern on June We request that you implement any changes required such as ISA GS, vendor code consolidation, or UPC EAN number changes after June at noon eastern. Schaeffler Group will begin processing EDI again on June th at am. Any documents that you send to Schaeffler after noon eastern on June should be in the new format so that when processing begins, the backlog will include the required changes. If this schedule changes, Schaeffler Group will contact you just as soon as possible. EDI traffic may be slower than usual on June th as Schaeffler Group will proceed with some caution to ensure accuracy. for your assistance.

","Mike, always provide the EPR material and the plant it is for in a ticket as well as the screenshots. The screen shots should provide the actual actual error message SAP is providing. That provides the information needed to correct the issues usually. EPR The problem was that no views for plant had been created for an expensed purchase from an external supplier. IPO The problem was the QM Procurement Key was missing. Changes in the material master in EP or by other plants in EP can cause this to happen. If it does, there is no option but to submit a ticket requesting the QM Key be created with the material and the plant This is usually a pretty quick fix. Mike RE Helpdesk ticket Concerning EPR IPO I need more info To All, Erica called me and I was able to prove out my theory of what was wrong with the st EPR and provided me with plant number for the nd one. So I have corrected both of them. Mike Mike Elmore Office Helpdesk ticket Concerning EPR IPO I need more info Concerning EPR Material I have made some changes I think were the problem but I need to test it. Erica has removed my purchasing roles so I cannot test to see if I get the result I am expecting now, I need for someone to call me and l will remote in to your PC so I can see what happens now for sure. Concerning IPO Material Error Missing QM Procurement Key I need to know what plant this is for before I can fix it Mike Mike Elmore Office "

Alongside, I have asked Shannon to evaluate gaps in the value stream between Stratford and Joplin Shannon almost immediately became frustrated with the duplicated effort for the printing differences between the Joplin set up versus the Stratford setup. We met with Catherine Plum, the purchasing buyer who sets up the scheduling agreement, to see if there was something unique that she does versus the client buyer Teresa Harrison. There is nothing she does to create these input. So that drives the investigation to SAP setting differences that Stratford must have developed over the years to reduce manual input. The attached highlighted input are empty on a Joplin Scheduling agreement, but the input is there when Catherine Plum creates a scheduling agreement. Can you investigate what it is that is coded into the system when Catherine enters a scheduling agreement that does not happen when Teresa Harrison enters a scheduling agreement that automatically populates the scheduling agreement print output. The exact expectation is that when anyone in purchasing enters a scheduling agreement across North America, the print output should be automatically in place and not manually entered by the inventory planner. ",The printer device names associated with the configuration of printer devices for buyer codes was invalid. Changed the printer definitions on the buyer configuratuions and the output determination worked as expected. Ticket will be closed.

Part set up and deliver a temporary laptop built with SEC to Shoukat's office by the end of the day connect this to the existing keyboard mouse monitor. Part pick up Shoukat's laptop first thing in the morning on Friday and bring back to your office for repair. The repairs can be done from Altura if you prefer but we're going to need time for backup before the drive is replaced, time to replace the drive, and time to restore data so do this from a location where you can be productive while waiting. Once you have the laptop, here's what we'll need to do Connect the laptop to the network and power on. Once at the login screen, contact Rob to do a administrative backup of the data. If Rob is not available, contact Preston for this task. This step will take approximatelyhours. Once the backup is complete, replace the drive. This is a unique drive for this laptop model. When replacing the drive, DO NOT disconnect the ribbon cable. The ribbon connects the drive to a special connector and this should be taken out and replaced as one unit. After the new drive is in place, rebuild the laptop through NetInstall like normal. After the build is complete, contact Rob to do a administrative restore of the data. If Rob is not available, contact Preston for this task. This step will take approximatelyhours. After restore is complete, deliver laptop back to Shoukat and reconnect keyboard, mouse, monitor to docking station. Issue was originally reported by IT colleagues in Mexico. Problems presented as poor performance in Outlook and Windows requesting a serial number"". Once connected to the laptop, Event viewer showed a bad block on the hard disk as the culprit. Windows was prompting for activation, virus scanner was paused, and overall performance was very sluggish. Attempted to run chkdsk b to resolve but after hours, chkdsk never advanced past and due to time restrictions this had to be aborted. Proceeded to backup data in MXC in preparation for drive replacement but during this step, the colleagues in MXC determined that the only p they had available also has a failed drive so repair was not possible. Drive needs to be replaced when Mr. Bhamani returns to Fort Mill. ","Swapped HD, reimaged. Provided loaner in interim. "

There are also problems when scheduling with his blackberry. If these problems are indeed due to miscommunication between systems, would it not be best if administrative groups were upgraded at the same time? Pat Will has had the same problems.

Looking at a few nodes, very little space is allocated to so tmp has a small amount of space. If we could allocate GB to tmp on all the child nodes, we could try this out to see if it works OK.

With Win Office when I right click in a cell it take seconds just to bring up the menu. Similar for creating folders. Win XP creates folders very quickly, there is a long delay with Win just to create a folder or rename it. This is really exagerated when I am on site at a customer trying to do it with a wireless card. Is something set wrong on my computer causing these delays?

Jim says this is wrong and would like more RAM. User called back asking for an update. He has to open up multiple layouts and work with them all simultaneously.

If he was just working on one document I don't think the user notices. But when multiple documents are being worked on at the same time it causes the laptop to freeze up and crash. check the size of the files he is using and what error he is getting when trying to open multiples. When using Autocad it DOES NOT allow me to open plant layout drawings at one time. This is a constant problem that takes away from the Users efficiency. I don't know if it is due to inadequate hardware or another reason. ,The AutoCAD hardware requirements should be the same as for ProE.
