I think that it is empty, so I m not sure if that will resolve the error. Chris RE COBRA Issue I am trying to test the COBRA changes and I have run into this issue This is one of the errors that I was running into as well. I think there is some issue with the forms still, unfortunately. What can I do to help? Kam Kam Myers RE COBRA Issue so much for your help Chris. Kam has to test these changes, she will be back on Monday, she is on vacation I wonder who approved that. Btw I know I said that we would get an ABAPer for the MX project but have you had a chance to look into the requirements? I was wondering if there is anything you would like to do. SvenOve Schreck RE COBRA Issue I have merged the SAP changes in with the Schaeffler customizations. I m not sure how to test it, so I m only hoping it works better now. CHris RE COBRA Issue Hey Chris, so much for your quick investigation. Let s just go ahead with the merging from standard includes to the Schaeffler specific includes. Since the process is currently broken anyways, no additional harm would be done. Regarding the C Kam said that it refers to some kind of form which we do not use. So the lines in which the C are being addressed should actually be commented out. How much effort do you think this would take from your side? again for your help. SvenOve Schreck RE COBRA Issue The issues seem to be in SGD HR PAUS COBF and SGD HR PAUS COBF There are many differences between these two files and the respective originals, but I do not see any conflicts where a specific line in each file differs. So, merging the changes should be straight forward. However, if the Schaeffler changes just do not work under EHP, then that would present another issue. I did find two sections of code in COBF that make reference to C, and that could simply be added to the Schaeffler version, but I would be a little surprised if that just worked. Since I am not familiar with this code, I am not sure which approach is desirable. We could start by adding the C code and continue adding code from the SAP standard until it runs, but there is no guarantee the merged files would work. COBRA Issue The COBRA process is run in three separate steps. The first step collects the events RPUCOB. This step is a standard SAP report, and still works as it should. The second step letter generation has been customized. The original report was RPUCOB, but David Oh copied the report to SGD HR PAUS RPUCOB so that he could add some ADP requirements. Over the past three years, the original RPUCOB has been updated through SAP support packages, but the custom report has only had some minor modifications documented in the report. After the EHP upgrade, the custom report is nonfunctional a runtime error occurs when trying to generate the report. My thought was to get the original report up and running so that it would be modified with the SAP support packages going forward. I tried this, but RPUCOB will not run successfully, due to the fact that it is looking for a form C . We do not have a form C, and I do not know how to create it. I have put some information in the ticket It might be as simple as creating the form, but I m just not sure. I hope this gave enough information let me know if more is needed! Kam "

This printer exists on USAVSS on both hp and hp. ","Hello John Robert, any Label printer we use in VSS is of type dpi. Zebra printfile, created via easy label also calculates with dots to be printed. That means that every printout on a dpi printer is half the size bigger as it should be. In former times we had a simular problem to print out labels from continetal, because they use only dpi printers. So if they try to print out on a vss production printer, labellayout was half the size too small. I do not have any idea which could helps you. They print out now over a special dpi printer in production in IWL. You are correct. However, I spoke with a Zebra representative, and he stated that whatever configuration the driver had will be the configuration used. What that means is even if I chang the print width on the printer device locally, if it is different than what is referenced in the driver, the value in the driver will override my change. I set up a print driver for Windows for this printer on my local computer, and changed the print width on that driver. This will allow me to print the correct width from Windows, but now I need to print the correct width from VSS by having someone update the print width reference on the driver that VSS uses. Is this something that you can help me with? In the Printerconfiguration site at Druckerkonfiguration anzeigen I see TRANSMISSIVE SENSOR SELECT THERMALTRANS.

The purpose of this email is to provide the latest information regarding the change so that we can make the implementation as smooth as possible and with minimum disruption. New Schedule Schaeffler Group will halt all inbound EDI processing June at noon eastern time. Schaeffler Group will continue processing outbound EDI to you based on inbound received prior to June at noon until approximately midnight eastern on June We request that you implement any changes required such as ISA GS, vendor code consolidation, or UPC EAN number changes after June at noon eastern. Schaeffler Group will begin processing EDI again on June th at am. Any documents that you send to Schaeffler after noon eastern on June should be in the new format so that when processing begins, the backlog will include the required changes. If this schedule changes, Schaeffler Group will contact you just as soon as possible. EDI traffic may be slower than usual on June th as Schaeffler Group will proceed with some caution to ensure accuracy. for your assistance.

As we discussed, I believe this is how we will proceed Purvis will make the change to the ID onsince Schaeffler will cease inbound processing at that time. Once Schaeffler restarts on the backlog will use the new identity. Schaeffler does not send supplier codes on return documents so that is not an issue.

Mr. Hart will use the PC's set up for training in the Plant computer lab see ticket for BearinX training participants that don't have their own laptop and the participants that do have a laptop will be asked to bring it to the training so we only need to provide network connections. Mr. Hart requested connections for participants so connections should be available in the Plant computer lab, connections in the Plant Move Simulation room, and any additional connections can be made via wireless network if necessary. Received an agreement from Mr. Bushman to direct requests for training equipment to the training group in Fort Mill. Waiting on confirmation from Larry Bost that he has notified his people that we'll be sending requests to them and I've requested for Larry to give us the contact information that we should provide. Contacted Steve Bushman NA Training Director to make him aware of this request, point out the conflict that we have with the training that Mushtaq has scheduled, and request some direction. My request to Mr. Bushman is to let IT close these requests with direction for people to contact the local training department to schedule training. Training in FM needs to be prepared to receive these requests though and to schedule their resources accordingly. Waiting on Mr. Bushman's response. I am requesting rental computers which meet the Schaeffler standards for Office system with a monitor larger than inches be provided for the upcoming Bearinx training class during the week Sept in the Plant move simulation rooms. Each computer requires network access to the following location. K need to be set up in each Move Training room based on the number of participants in each class each day.

Alongside, I have asked Shannon to evaluate gaps in the value stream between Stratford and Joplin Shannon almost immediately became frustrated with the duplicated effort for the printing differences between the Joplin set up versus the Stratford setup. We met with Catherine Plum, the purchasing buyer who sets up the scheduling agreement, to see if there was something unique that she does versus the client buyer Teresa Harrison. There is nothing she does to create these input. So that drives the investigation to SAP setting differences that Stratford must have developed over the years to reduce manual input. The attached highlighted input are empty on a Joplin Scheduling agreement, but the input is there when Catherine Plum creates a scheduling agreement. Can you investigate what it is that is coded into the system when Catherine enters a scheduling agreement that does not happen when Teresa Harrison enters a scheduling agreement that automatically populates the scheduling agreement print output. The exact expectation is that when anyone in purchasing enters a scheduling agreement across North America, the print output should be automatically in place and not manually entered by the inventory planner.

Part set up and deliver a temporary laptop built with SEC to Shoukat's office by the end of the day connect this to the existing keyboard mouse monitor. Part pick up Shoukat's laptop first thing in the morning on Friday and bring back to your office for repair. The repairs can be done from Altura if you prefer but we're going to need time for backup before the drive is replaced, time to replace the drive, and time to restore data so do this from a location where you can be productive while waiting. Once you have the laptop, here's what we'll need to do Connect the laptop to the network and power on. Once at the login screen, contact Rob to do a administrative backup of the data. If Rob is not available, contact Preston for this task. This step will take approximatelyhours. Once the backup is complete, replace the drive. This is a unique drive for this laptop model. When replacing the drive, DO NOT disconnect the ribbon cable. The ribbon connects the drive to a special connector and this should be taken out and replaced as one unit. After the new drive is in place, rebuild the laptop through NetInstall like normal. After the build is complete, contact Rob to do a administrative restore of the data. If Rob is not available, contact Preston for this task. This step will take approximatelyhours. After restore is complete, deliver laptop back to Shoukat and reconnect keyboard, mouse, monitor to docking station. Issue was originally reported by IT colleagues in Mexico. Problems presented as poor performance in Outlook and Windows requesting a serial number"". Once connected to the laptop, Event viewer showed a bad block on the hard disk as the culprit. Windows was prompting for activation, virus scanner was paused, and overall performance was very sluggish. Attempted to run chkdsk b to resolve but after hours, chkdsk never advanced past and due to time restrictions this had to be aborted. Proceeded to backup data in MXC in preparation for drive replacement but during this step, the colleagues in MXC determined that the only p they had available also has a failed drive so repair was not possible. Drive needs to be replaced when Mr. Bhamani returns to Fort Mill. ","Swapped HD, reimaged. Provided loaner in interim. "

The other issue, however, appears to deal with how the system determines who should get the back to green emails. When presented with a workstation that changed its status to production', it would find the last event that was of type production', setup', or other downtime'. The back to green mail was sent to all user's that had been notified by the system between these two events. However, the stamping presses frequently cycle from a repair state to a setup state and then to production. In this situation, the software would not send any notifications since its last good state was the setup that preceeded the return to production. The system has been modified to only consider production as a valid previous state. With this change, all personnel that were notified of an issue between the current event and the previous production event will be notified that the workstation is back in production. "

Want to follow up with user on this tomorrow when he has more time. Since changing to Window and Office it takes significantly longer to work with files in Buehl from Wooster. For Example I am using an Excel sheet, with Windows XP I can right click in a cell and nearly instantly get the appropriate menu. With Win Office when I right click in a cell it take seconds just to bring up the menu. Similar for creating folders. Win XP creates folders very quickly, there is a long delay with Win just to create a folder or rename it. This is really exagerated when I am on site at a customer trying to do it with a wireless card. Is something set wrong on my computer causing these delays? I can't imagine an upgrade should make thing this much worse. It takes really significantly longer to do the same work with Win and Office than with WinXP and Office Greg ","The folder path is too long, office running out of memory trying to read a file with a long name long folder path.

I saved a ppt that resides in Germany and timed it on the network hub and directly plugged in. The times were nearly identical. Today it saved directly in and thru the network hub in This is significantly improved from the day I wrote the help desk ticket. On that day I was saving a slide ppt and it was taking over minutes. The day I wrote the ticket my network speed for copying files was running something like kBb sec, this morning I was running at just over Mb sec. I just tried again and the network speed was around kB sec. The frustrating part is the old XP computer works MUCH faster than the new computer. It is going thru the same network hub Greg User is complaining about the network speed with his Windows Office laptop. It is taking longer to copy data and open and save files. Most of his work is done in Germany and the wait time has increased since his upgrades. When using his toughbook XP Office on the same connecction the time is much faster. His laptop is plugged into a netgear hub along with other devices. I suspect that this is the cause of his network problems. Can you check his network connection? Is he in a hub? Also try moving him to another port in the switch or another switch. Called Gregory, logged onto his pc,he was showing the files and folders where he had to access and the times it was taking to open them. Told me that on the other computer he had better network speed, that this one ony shows kb s. Line was breaking up, was kicked out of the phone, tried to call him back,he told me that needs to have the Laptop checked up, the network speed is not the best, needs to get it checked up and check the network and wireless drivers and settings on it. Check what could be wrong with the access and network I am having problems with network access times and saving files on Buehl servers with my new Win Office machine. As an example I did a SaveAs on a slide ppt presentation in both my Win Office machine as well as on my older testing Toughbook Win XP Office On my new Win Office machine it took min seconds to save. On the Win XP Office it took seconds. Earlier this morning I needed a file from Germany and copied it locally. After starting the copy to the desktop on the new Win machine, I navigated to the folder and started copying the same file on the Toughbook to the desktop. Even with a significant head start for the Win machine, the Toughbook XP finished min seconds sooner than the Win machine. It seems something is wrong with the network access on the new machine. Greg Heeke ",Checked with network and software groups. There is no way they are aware of to improve the speed for the data transfers and the file open and saves with Windows and Office

Can you check the settings on the printer? Destery Pumphrey call asking for an update. His not too sure of what SAP system his printing from, nor the transaction. You can turn off the Width Sensor. see Instructions below Let me know if the width sensor can be turn off. not sure what the default paper size for the jobs he's suppost to be printing are. routing tags. Can you verify the name of the System and transaction. ext Printer V is not printing. It keeps giving an error paper width error"". It is in Press room in Wooster. ",Found out that the print head wasn't calibrating properly. I adjusted the print head so it wasn't gouging the paper and causing a hardware problem. I also cleared the paper width fault. I worked with the operator at the ton and he was good with the tag. Destery wasn't in so i set the good routing tags on his keyboard. When I looked at the printer it had a hardware alarm. I reset the printer to defaults and cleaned it out. I was able to print routing tags with no alarm after I did this. The ribbon looks like it needs changed soon also.

Jim says this is wrong and would like more RAM. User called back asking for an update. He has to open up multiple layouts and work with them all simultaneously. Doing this causes the program to crash. I agree with Doug that the hardware is insufficient to run the program in the manner that they are using it. If he was just working on one document I don't think the user notices. But when multiple documents are being worked on at the same time it causes the laptop to freeze up and crash. check the size of the files he is using and what error he is getting when trying to open multiples. When using Autocad it DOES NOT allow me to open plant layout drawings at one time. This is a constant problem that takes away from the Users efficiency. I don't know if it is due to inadequate hardware or another reason. ,The AutoCAD hardware requirements should be the same as for ProE.

Still had the same problem. I logged into my username and tried to print but had the same problem. Rob rolled the driver back for the printer and the problem seemed to go away. Scott was in a meeting and couldn't test under his username. I sent him an email to have him check and give me the results. Moved the port this computer was plugged into to a different port on another switch. I also used a new cable. I deleted and readded the printer v. Tried printing from notepad, wordpad, and outlook to this printer and still got the error. We tried printing to another lexmark v and was able to print with no problem or error message. Connected to Mr. Strong's PC and ran the Printer Reset application from NetInstall to clear and reload print drivers but no change. NetInstall opened slower than expected, printing works but it takes a few minutes for a simple print job to reach the server from Mr. Strong's PC, and he asked if overall network performance was getting slower because he's been noticing delays in other network activities. Pinged the printer and the print server from and the responses seemed somewhat normal most response times were <ms or ms but when I pinged from my PC, I noticed that the response times were slower than expected ranged from <ms to ms. change to a different network port and see if this improves the performance. ",Rolled the printer driver back to the previous version and the computer is now able to print again sucessfully.
