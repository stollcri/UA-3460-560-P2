CHris RE COBRA Issue Hey Chris, so much for your quick investigation. Let s just go ahead with the merging from standard includes to the Schaeffler specific includes. Since the process is currently broken anyways, no additional harm would be done. Regarding the C Kam said that it refers to some kind of form which we do not use. So the lines in which the C are being addressed should actually be commented out. How much effort do you think this would take from your side? again for your help. SvenOve Schreck RE COBRA Issue The issues seem to be in SGD HR PAUS COBF and SGD HR PAUS COBF There are many differences between these two files and the respective originals, but I do not see any conflicts where a specific line in each file differs. So, merging the changes should be straight forward. However, if the Schaeffler changes just do not work under EHP, then that would present another issue. I did find two sections of code in COBF that make reference to C, and that could simply be added to the Schaeffler version, but I would be a little surprised if that just worked. Since I am not familiar with this code, I am not sure which approach is desirable. We could start by adding the C code and continue adding code from the SAP standard until it runs, but there is no guarantee the merged files would work. COBRA Issue The COBRA process is run in three separate steps. The first step collects the events RPUCOB. This step is a standard SAP report, and still works as it should. The second step letter generation has been customized. The original report was RPUCOB, but David Oh copied the report to SGD HR PAUS RPUCOB so that he could add some ADP requirements. Over the past three years, the original RPUCOB has been updated through SAP support packages, but the custom report has only had some minor modifications documented in the report. After the EHP upgrade, the custom report is nonfunctional a runtime error occurs when trying to generate the report. My thought was to get the original report up and running so that it would be modified with the SAP support packages going forward. I tried this, but RPUCOB will not run successfully, due to the fact that it is looking for a form C . We do not have a form C, and I do not know how to create it. I have put some information in the ticket It might be as simple as creating the form, but I m just not sure. I hope this gave enough information let me know if more is needed! Kam "

This printer exists on USAVSS on both hp and hp. ","Hello John Robert, any Label printer we use in VSS is of type dpi. Zebra printfile, created via easy label also calculates with dots to be printed. That means that every printout on a dpi printer is half the size bigger as it should be. In former times we had a simular problem to print out labels from continetal, because they use only dpi printers. So if they try to print out on a vss production printer, labellayout was half the size too small. I do not have any idea which could helps you. They print out now over a special dpi printer in production in IWL. You are correct. However, I spoke with a Zebra representative, and he stated that whatever configuration the driver had will be the configuration used. What that means is even if I chang the print width on the printer device locally, if it is different than what is referenced in the driver, the value in the driver will override my change. I set up a print driver for Windows for this printer on my local computer, and changed the print width on that driver. This will allow me to print the correct width from Windows, but now I need to print the correct width from VSS by having someone update the print width reference on the driver that VSS uses. Is this something that you can help me with? In the Printerconfiguration site at Druckerkonfiguration anzeigen I see TRANSMISSIVE SENSOR SELECT THERMALTRANS.
