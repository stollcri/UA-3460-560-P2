I spoke to Shoukat and he will let us know if any problems with his computer. Es let me kno when you get a chance so we can talk about his computer. I dust off the inside of the laptop. Fan does make an unusual noise maybe it is not spining fast enough to keep the computer cool. Also not sure why his computer was taking to long to go to sleep after you close the lid.It took about to min I change it from sleep to Stand By and back to Sleep mode, I close the Lid again and much better s to min. Left the Computer on Beth Kantus desk. Went up to Shoukat's desk, however only had maybe minutes to take a look at issue. Took a screenshot of issue. Informed Beth, we need to have machine for atleast hours to do hardware testing. Tomorrow maybe? She would speak to him and let us know. Alot of the times is happening in the morning. Felt the bottom of the laptop and was very hot. Wondering if user uses his laptop at his house. Then without shutting it off, puts it into his bag and come to work. Maybe overheating while in bag? There is nothing blocking the air flow for the docking station computer. I called Beth and Shoukat left Some file transf from his sent Items to a Personal folder. Beth wanted me to wait till this is done and she would like somebody to come over and take a look at the computer physically. User says he will have time today at am. He will leave his computer with Beth Kantus so we can take a look at. User says the computer turns off by it self. Will call beth at am to check event Viewer. could be the computer shutdowns by it self if it gets too hot. Or a bad driver. Talked to Beth Kantus for rd time to schedule. She said she would talk to Shoukat and let me know either way. Talked to Beth Kantus to schedule time to look at it. No time today but she will contact me back when time is available next week. contact Shoukat Bhamani and schedule a time to get his laptop so that we can check laptop and see if we can find out why it's shutting down. User would like to schedule sometime for his computer to be looked at. User will be available on monday. I call user, No answer. to call SD. Left VM for Shoukat to call the SD. Check the even log and see if there is any history about why the computer shutdown. Otherwise send this to the local IT.

Mark Ogden is the new CA East sales rep taking over Gregory Peacock's old territory. Gregory Peacock will now be workign in CA WEST. let me know if you have any questions. Yolanda ,email to Jessica Hargett Shaun Kelly and Yolanda McCutcheon. Would you verify HP information for Mark Odgen and Gregory Peacock. Both users are assigned to same position number and both are valid to same position as of yesterday meaning they can see exact same info in SAP and probably portal. Yolanda Mark and Gregory exists on same HR position. This is why SAMS says Role for system group PRD is already assigned to employee Gregory Peacock . If Mark stays on position then he will keep role and Gregory may have to have role requested again under new position.

RE Schaeffler Group EDI Change Request Purvis Hi Nancy As you know, Schaeffler Group North America is implementing changes that will impact your EDI relationship. The purpose of this email is to provide the latest information regarding the change so that we can make the implementation as smooth as possible and with minimum disruption. New Schedule Schaeffler Group will halt all inbound EDI processing June at noon eastern time. Schaeffler Group will continue processing outbound EDI to you based on inbound received prior to June at noon until approximately midnight eastern on June We request that you implement any changes required such as ISA GS, vendor code consolidation, or UPC EAN number changes after June at noon eastern. Schaeffler Group will begin processing EDI again on June th at am. Any documents that you send to Schaeffler after noon eastern on June should be in the new format so that when processing begins, the backlog will include the required changes. If this schedule changes, Schaeffler Group will contact you just as soon as possible. EDI traffic may be slower than usual on June th as Schaeffler Group will proceed with some caution to ensure accuracy. for your assistance. Doyle Shelton Schaeffler Group NA EDI Team Lead com RE Schaeffler Group EDI Change Request Purvis Hi Nancy It was a pleasure speaking with you today and I appreciate your time. As we discussed, I believe this is how we will proceed Purvis will make the change to the ID onsince Schaeffler will cease inbound processing at that time. Once Schaeffler restarts on the backlog will use the new identity. Schaeffler does not send supplier codes on return documents so that is not an issue. If you are required to send UPC codes, then you are already sending them. again for your excellent help.

Waiting on confirmation from Larry Bost that he has notified his people that we'll be sending requests to them and I've requested for Larry to give us the contact information that we should provide. Contacted Steve Bushman NA Training Director to make him aware of this request, point out the conflict that we have with the training that Mushtaq has scheduled, and request some direction. My request to Mr. Bushman is to let IT close these requests with direction for people to contact the local training department to schedule training. Training in FM needs to be prepared to receive these requests though and to schedule their resources accordingly. Waiting on Mr. Bushman's response. I am requesting rental computers which meet the Schaeffler standards for Office system with a monitor larger than inches be provided for the upcoming Bearinx training class during the week Sept in the Plant move simulation rooms.

Alongside, I have asked Shannon to evaluate gaps in the value stream between Stratford and Joplin Shannon almost immediately became frustrated with the duplicated effort for the printing differences between the Joplin set up versus the Stratford setup. We met with Catherine Plum, the purchasing buyer who sets up the scheduling agreement, to see if there was something unique that she does versus the client buyer Teresa Harrison. There is nothing she does to create these input. So that drives the investigation to SAP setting differences that Stratford must have developed over the years to reduce manual input. The attached highlighted input are empty on a Joplin Scheduling agreement, but the input is there when Catherine Plum creates a scheduling agreement. Can you investigate what it is that is coded into the system when Catherine enters a scheduling agreement that does not happen when Teresa Harrison enters a scheduling agreement that automatically populates the scheduling agreement print output. The exact expectation is that when anyone in purchasing enters a scheduling agreement across North America, the print output should be automatically in place and not manually entered by the inventory planner.

Part pick up Shoukat's laptop first thing in the morning on Friday and bring back to your office for repair. The repairs can be done from Altura if you prefer but we're going to need time for backup before the drive is replaced, time to replace the drive, and time to restore data so do this from a location where you can be productive while waiting. Once you have the laptop, here's what we'll need to do Connect the laptop to the network and power on. Once at the login screen, contact Rob to do a administrative backup of the data. If Rob is not available, contact Preston for this task. This step will take approximatelyhours. Once the backup is complete, replace the drive. This is a unique drive for this laptop model. When replacing the drive, DO NOT disconnect the ribbon cable. The ribbon connects the drive to a special connector and this should be taken out and replaced as one unit. After the new drive is in place, rebuild the laptop through NetInstall like normal. After the build is complete, contact Rob to do a administrative restore of the data. If Rob is not available, contact Preston for this task. This step will take approximatelyhours. After restore is complete, deliver laptop back to Shoukat and reconnect keyboard, mouse, monitor to docking station. Issue was originally reported by IT colleagues in Mexico. Problems presented as poor performance in Outlook and Windows requesting a serial number"". Once connected to the laptop, Event viewer showed a bad block on the hard disk as the culprit. Windows was prompting for activation, virus scanner was paused, and overall performance was very sluggish. Attempted to run chkdsk b to resolve but after hours, chkdsk never advanced past and due to time restrictions this had to be aborted. Proceeded to backup data in MXC in preparation for drive replacement but during this step, the colleagues in MXC determined that the only p they had available also has a failed drive so repair was not possible. Drive needs to be replaced when Mr. Bhamani returns to Fort Mill. ","Swapped HD, reimaged. Provided loaner in interim. "
