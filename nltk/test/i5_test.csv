Fax Planisware Server Access Good afternoon Trevor, I have been experiencing Planisware server proxy errors anytime between pm and pm for the past couple of weeks.

As you can understand it has been frustrating to be working in the system, logging in as usual, then losing all work completed when one attempts to save while the server is down. If this is due to daily system synchronizations or maintenance perhaps a region wide warning via email or the INANet would be of benefit?

SGD HR PAUS RPUCOB Created customizing transport HDK. Created workbench transport HDK. COMMERCIAL BAM R NA Email correspondence I m not really sure what to do here. I inspected the SAPscript form HR BEN COB LET and it s MAIN window did not have a text element called DEPEND AT EACH PERSON under form info the element was listed, but nothing was displayed when MAIN was actually inspected, so I added the text element to MAIN. I think that it is empty, so I m not sure if that will resolve the error. Chris RE COBRA Issue I am trying to test the COBRA changes and I have run into this issue This is one of the errors that I was running into as well. I think there is some issue with the forms still, unfortunately. What can I do to help? Kam Kam Myers RE COBRA Issue so much for your help Chris. Kam has to test these changes, she will be back on Monday, she is on vacation I wonder who approved that. Btw I know I said that we would get an ABAPer for the MX project but have you had a chance to look into the requirements? I was wondering if there is anything you would like to do. SvenOve Schreck RE COBRA Issue I have merged the SAP changes in with the Schaeffler customizations. I m not sure how to test it, so I m only hoping it works better now. CHris RE COBRA Issue Hey Chris, so much for your quick investigation. Let s just go ahead with the merging from standard includes to the Schaeffler specific includes. Since the process is currently broken anyways, no additional harm would be done. Regarding the C Kam said that it refers to some kind of form which we do not use. So the lines in which the C are being addressed should actually be commented out. How much effort do you think this would take from your side? again for your help. SvenOve Schreck RE COBRA Issue The issues seem to be in SGD HR PAUS COBF and SGD HR PAUS COBF There are many differences between these two files and the respective originals, but I do not see any conflicts where a specific line in each file differs. So, merging the changes should be straight forward. However, if the Schaeffler changes just do not work under EHP, then that would present another issue. I did find two sections of code in COBF that make reference to C, and that could simply be added to the Schaeffler version, but I would be a little surprised if that just worked. Since I am not familiar with this code, I am not sure which approach is desirable. We could start by adding the C code and continue adding code from the SAP standard until it runs, but there is no guarantee the merged files would work. COBRA Issue The COBRA process is run in three separate steps. The first step collects the events RPUCOB. This step is a standard SAP report, and still works as it should. The second step letter generation has been customized. The original report was RPUCOB, but David Oh copied the report to SGD HR PAUS RPUCOB so that he could add some ADP requirements. Over the past three years, the original RPUCOB has been updated through SAP support packages, but the custom report has only had some minor modifications documented in the report. After the EHP upgrade, the custom report is nonfunctional a runtime error occurs when trying to generate the report. My thought was to get the original report up and running so that it would be modified with the SAP support packages going forward. I tried this, but RPUCOB will not run successfully, due to the fact that it is looking for a form C . We do not have a form C, and I do not know how to create it. I have put some information in the ticket It might be as simple as creating the form, but I m just not sure. I hope this gave enough information let me know if more is needed! Kam "

If possible, obtain MAC address from this printer and set up as MDHCP. d is set as a MDHCP object. Both printers confirmed to be offline. It's not clear where Mr. Catoe moved from and to, but I suspect that these printers are now located on a different VLAN which means that the MDHCP objects need to be moved within QIP from the old VLAN to the new VLAN. clarify with the user where these printers are located and note the new VLAN in the ticket. note that if you are able to change dr from a static object to MDHCP object, the device itself will most likely need to be configured to use DHCP. ","Had Es more the entries to the propersubnet ..xx, reset printers to boot DHCP and verified functioning. "

If it does, there is no option but to submit a ticket requesting the QM Key be created with the material and the plant This is usually a pretty quick fix.

Part set up and deliver a temporary laptop built with SEC to Shoukat's office by the end of the day connect this to the existing keyboard mouse monitor. Part pick up Shoukat's laptop first thing in the morning on Friday and bring back to your office for repair. The repairs can be done from Altura if you prefer but we're going to need time for backup before the drive is replaced, time to replace the drive, and time to restore data so do this from a location where you can be productive while waiting. Once you have the laptop, here's what we'll need to do Connect the laptop to the network and power on. Once at the login screen, contact Rob to do a administrative backup of the data. If Rob is not available, contact Preston for this task. This step will take approximatelyhours. Once the backup is complete, replace the drive. This is a unique drive for this laptop model. When replacing the drive, DO NOT disconnect the ribbon cable. The ribbon connects the drive to a special connector and this should be taken out and replaced as one unit. After the new drive is in place, rebuild the laptop through NetInstall like normal. After the build is complete, contact Rob to do a administrative restore of the data. If Rob is not available, contact Preston for this task. This step will take approximatelyhours. After restore is complete, deliver laptop back to Shoukat and reconnect keyboard, mouse, monitor to docking station. Issue was originally reported by IT colleagues in Mexico. Problems presented as poor performance in Outlook and Windows requesting a serial number"". Once connected to the laptop, Event viewer showed a bad block on the hard disk as the culprit. Windows was prompting for activation, virus scanner was paused, and overall performance was very sluggish. Attempted to run chkdsk b to resolve but after hours, chkdsk never advanced past and due to time restrictions this had to be aborted. Proceeded to backup data in MXC in preparation for drive replacement but during this step, the colleagues in MXC determined that the only p they had available also has a failed drive so repair was not possible. Drive needs to be replaced when Mr. Bhamani returns to Fort Mill. ","Swapped HD, reimaged. Provided loaner in interim. "

I saved a ppt that resides in Germany and timed it on the network hub and directly plugged in. The times were nearly identical. Today it saved directly in and thru the network hub in This is significantly improved from the day I wrote the help desk ticket. On that day I was saving a slide ppt and it was taking over minutes. The day I wrote the ticket my network speed for copying files was running something like kBb sec, this morning I was running at just over Mb sec. I just tried again and the network speed was around kB sec. The frustrating part is the old XP computer works MUCH faster than the new computer. It is going thru the same network hub Greg User is complaining about the network speed with his Windows Office laptop. It is taking longer to copy data and open and save files. Most of his work is done in Germany and the wait time has increased since his upgrades. When using his toughbook XP Office on the same connecction the time is much faster. His laptop is plugged into a netgear hub along with other devices. I suspect that this is the cause of his network problems. Can you check his network connection? Is he in a hub? Also try moving him to another port in the switch or another switch. Called Gregory, logged onto his pc,he was showing the files and folders where he had to access and the times it was taking to open them. Told me that on the other computer he had better network speed, that this one ony shows kb s. Line was breaking up, was kicked out of the phone, tried to call him back,he told me that needs to have the Laptop checked up, the network speed is not the best, needs to get it checked up and check the network and wireless drivers and settings on it. Check what could be wrong with the access and network I am having problems with network access times and saving files on Buehl servers with my new Win Office machine. As an example I did a SaveAs on a slide ppt presentation in both my Win Office machine as well as on my older testing Toughbook Win XP Office On my new Win Office machine it took min seconds to save. On the Win XP Office it took seconds. Earlier this morning I needed a file from Germany and copied it locally. After starting the copy to the desktop on the new Win machine, I navigated to the folder and started copying the same file on the Toughbook to the desktop. Even with a significant head start for the Win machine, the Toughbook XP finished min seconds sooner than the Win machine. It seems something is wrong with the network access on the new machine. Greg Heeke ",Checked with network and software groups. There is no way they are aware of to improve the speed for the data transfers and the file open and saves with Windows and Office
